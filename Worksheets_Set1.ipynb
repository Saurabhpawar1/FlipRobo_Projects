For a normal distribution, 68% of the observations are within +/- one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within +/- two standard deviations, and 99.7% are within +- three standard deviations.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Firstly I will interpret that why there are missing values in our dataset. For instance some people hesitate to put down the information for eample Men hesitate to put down the salary and Women hesitate to put down the age, Survey informations are not that valid, People may have died.\n",

    "    \n",
    "        i) Missing at Random (MAR):\n",
    "        Missing at random means that the propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data, but it is related to some of the observed data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ii) Missing Completely at Random (MCAR): \n",
    "        The fact that a certain value is missing has nothing to do with its hypothetical value and with the values of other variables.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        iii) Missing not at Random (MNAR):\n",
    "        Two possible reasons are that the missing value depends on the hypothetical value (e.g. People with high salaries generally do not want to reveal their incomes in surveys) or missing value is dependent on some other variable’s value (e.g. Let’s assume that females generally don’t want to reveal their ages! Here the missing value in age variable is impacted by gender variable)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3. In the first two cases, it is safe to remove the data with missing values depending upon their occurrences, while in the third case removing observations with missing values can produce a bias in the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Very basic type of imputation technique is Computing the overall mean, it is the only tested function that takes no advantage of the time series characteristics or relationship between the variables. It is very fast, but has clear disadvantages. One disadvantage is that mean imputation reduces variance in the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. There are other machine learning techniques like XGBoost and Random Forest for data imputation but personally my favorite imputation technique is KNN(K Nearest Neighbors) and alos it is widely used. In this method, k neighbors are chosen based on some distance measure and their average is used as an imputation estimate. The method requires the selection of the number of nearest neighbors, and a distance metric. KNN can predict both discrete attributes (the most frequent value among the k nearest neighbors) and continuous attributes (the mean among the k nearest neighbors)"

    "    \n",
    "    4. In the above scenario, you may divide the products into two parts – A and B. Here A will remain unchanged while you make significant changes in B’s packaging. Now, on the basis of the response from customer groups who used A and B respectively, you try to decide which is performing better.\n",

    "    6. A/B testing works best when testing incremental changes, such as UX changes, new features, ranking, and page load times. Here you may compare pre and post-modification results to decide whether the changes are working as desired or not.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. A/B testing doesn’t work well when testing major changes, like new products, new branding, or completely new user experiences. In these cases, there may be effects that drive higher than normal engagement or emotional responses that may cause users to behave in a different manner."

    "    A data warehouse is subject-oriented, as it provides information on a topic rather than the ongoing operations of organizations. Such issues may be inventory, promotion, storage, etc. Never does a data warehouse concentrate on the current processes. Instead, it emphasized modeling and analyzing decision-making data. It also provides a simple and succinct description of the particular subject by excluding details that would not be useful in helping the decision process.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Integration in Data Warehouse means establishing a standard unit of measurement from the different databases for all the similar data. The data must also get stored in a simple and universally acceptable manner within the Data Warehouse. Through combining data from various sources such as a mainframe, relational databases, flat files, etc., a data warehouse is created. It must also keep the naming conventions, format, and coding consistent. Such an application assists in robust data analysis. Consistency must be maintained in naming conventions, measurements of characteristics, specification of encoding, etc.\n",

It also assists in analyzing historical data and in understanding what and when it happened. The transaction process, recovery, and competitiveness control mechanisms are not required. In the Data Warehouse environment, activities such as deleting, updating, and inserting that are performed in an operational application environment are omitted."

    "        ii) link the clusters\n",

    "        iii) choose a solution by selecting the right number of clusters\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. First, we have to select the variables upon which we base our clusters. In the dialog window we add the math, reading, and writing tests to the list of variables.  Since we want to cluster cases we leave the rest of the tick marks on the default.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. In the dialog box Statistics we can specify whether we want to output the proximity matrix (these are the distances calculated in the first step of the analysis) and the predicted cluster membership of the cases in our observations. Again, we leave all settings on default.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. In the dialog box Plots we should add the Dendrogram. The Dendrogram will graphically show how the clusters are merged and allows us to identify what the appropriate number of clusters is.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. The dialog box Method… allows us to specify the distance measure and the clustering method.  First, we need to define the correct distance measure.  SPSS offers three large blocks of distance measures for interval (scale), counts (ordinal), and binary (nominal) data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. For interval data, the most common is Square Euclidian Distance. It is based on the Euclidian Distance between two observations, which is the square root of the sum of squared distances. Since the Euclidian Distance is squared, it increases the importance of large distances, while weakening the importance of small distances.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. If we have ordinal data (counts) we can select between Chi-Square or a standardized Chi-Square called Phi-Square.  For binary data, the Squared Euclidean Distance is commonly used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    8. Next, we have to choose the Cluster Method.  Typically, choices are between-groups linkage, nearest neighbor, furthest neighbor, and Ward’s method. Single linkage works best with long chains of clusters, while complete linkage works best with dense blobs of clusters.  Between-groups linkage works with both cluster types.  It is recommended is to use single linkage first.  Although single linkage tends to create chains of clusters, it helps in identifying outliers.  After excluding these outliers, we can move onto Ward’s method.  Ward’s method uses the F value (like in ANOVA) to maximize the significance of differences between clusters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    9. A last consideration is standardization. If the variables have different scales and means we might want to standardize either to Z scores or by centering the scale. We can also transform the values to absolute values if we have a data set where this might be appropriate."
