       " 'Florence, February 23: Erick Pulgar’s late penalty salvaged a 1-1 Serie A draw for 10-man Fiorentina against Milan on Saturday (February 22). Fiorentina were heading for defeat at Stadio Artemio Franchi, but Asmir Begovic – on in place of the injured Gianluigi Donnarumma – was unable to keep out a Pulgar spot-kick five minutes from time after Alessio Romagnoli was adjudged to have fouled former Patrick Cutrone. Pulgar’s penalty cancelled out Ante Rebic’s second-half opener, with the Croatia forward having netted his sixth goal in his last six Serie A appearances. Matters looked even bleaker for Fiorentina when Dalbert was shown a red card for a foul on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but ultimately it was Milan who were left hanging on, Dusan Vlahovic and Martin Caceres missing late chances to win it. Donnarumma was lucky not to be punished for a sloppy mistake in the 13th minute, with Gaetano Castrovilli blazing over after Milan’s goalkeeper conceded possession. Rebic should have made Fiorentina pay for a poorly executed offside trap soon after, yet directed a close-range header at Bartlomiej Dragowski. Ibrahimovic made no such mistake with Milan’s next opening, slotting coolly beyond Dragowski after getting the better of two defenders, only for the goal to be disallowed for handball after a VAR check. Despite Donnarumma succumbing to injury early in the second half, Milan hit the front in the 56th minute – Rebic thumping home via a deflection after capitalising on Caceres’ error. Fiorentina’s frustrations were swiftly compounded when Dalbert, despite initially escaping with a booking for a professional foul on Ibrahimovic, was dismissed for a professional foul after the referee checked the replay. However, Giuseppe Iachini’s roll of the dice to introduce ex-Milan striker Cutrone paid off when he drew a tackle from Romagnoli and, though it seemed as if the defender got the ball, Fiorentina were awarded a penalty. Begovic got a hand to Pulgar’s spot-kick but was unable to keep it out and Fiorentina went for the jugular, but neither Caceres or Vlahovic could keep their cool to snatch all three points.',\n",

At a news conference, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte confirmed Sunday’s fixtures in the Lombardy and Veneto regions, including the Hellas Verona-Cagliari and Atalanta-Sassuolo clashes, would not go ahead. powered by Rubicon Project The move comes as part of preventative measures against the spread of the coronavirus, officially named Covid-19, after two people died and dozens more reportedly tested positive. Saturday’s scheduled Serie B match between Ascoli and Cremonese was earlier postponed and up to 88 amateur football matches were also called off, according to Italian news agency ANSA. In a short statement, Inter announced only that their meeting with Sampdoria at San Siro was postponed “to a later date”. The third-placed Nerazzurri sit six points behind Serie A leaders Juventus, who won 2-1 against SPAL on Saturday (February 22). Sunday’s three other games are expected to go ahead as planned.

       " 'Barcelona, Februaary 23: Lionel Messi scored four goals and Barcelona reclaimed top spot in La Liga as Real Madrid suffered a surprise defeat to Levante on Saturday (February 22), a week before the Clasico. Madrid’s nightmare afternoon was made worse by another injury to Eden Hazard, who was forced off in the second half of their 1-0 defeat in Valencia and is now doubtful to face Manchester City on Wednesday (February 26) in the Champions League. “It doesn’t look good,” said Real coach Zinedine Zidane afterwards. Messi, meanwhile, ridiculed talk of a drought by scoring four goals against Eibar after four games without one, while emergency signing Martin Braithwaite made two assists off the bench, teeing up Messi and then Arthur Melo in injury-time. Their 5-0 rout, coupled with Madrid’s defeat, means Barca move back to the summit of La Liga, two points ahead of Zidane’s side ahead of next Saturday’s showdown at the Santiago Bernabeu. “We’ve had good times this season and now this is a bad time,” said Zidane. “Now we have a week where everything is at stake.” It amounts to a considerable shift in momentum, with Barcelona away at Napoli in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday (February 25). Madrid host City a day later and the plan had been for Hazard to regain form and fitness in what was only his second start since returning from three months out with a broken right foot. But the Belgian sat in the dug-out with an ice pack around the same foot after going off and Zidane suggested it was a repeat injury after the match. “It can be weak where you’ve had an injury,” he said. “It’s sore now but we will see tomorrow after more tests.” Madrid were shaken by Hazard’s departure and Levante capitalised as Jose Luis Morales banged a shot into the top corner from the angle, even if Thibaut Courtois pulled out of a save he should have made.',\n",

       " 'MUMBAI: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Saturday said the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government will last its full term. Speaking at the “Vision Maharashtra” event organised by Marathi news channel ABP Majha, Pawar praised Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who heads the Sena, for his leadership. “I have no doubt that the state government will complete its full tenure of five years,” the NCP chief said. Pawar’s party is a part of the Sena-led government, along with the Congress. “Uddhav Thackeray is the kind of person who takes everyone forward with him,” he said. When asked to rate the performance of Thackeray as CM, Pawar said the former has not yet faced an exam, but he is walking on the right path. “He gives his colleagues chance to do good work,” Pawar added. When asked about the differences in views among the three ruling constituents, Pawar said, “This is a coalition government. Once a coalition is formed, and it has decided to come together. (It is assumed that) One has agreed to certain terms, then there is no bitterness and discontent in the equation. There are not many hurdles in running the government”. “The Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress know that they have to play a key role in making the MVA successful,” the NCP chief said. He refuted the speculation that the remote control of the government is in his hands. “I have a very clear approach toward this alliance. I will not give my opinions until I am asked. If any decision is affecting the state negatively, then I discuss it at the party level, not in the government. We have a coordination committee now with two representatives from each party to solve contentious issues. I do not interfere in the government,” he said. Pawar, however, said if there are some questions related to the Centre and Maharashtra then the ruling parties sit together and deliberate on them. His comments came on the backdrop of Thackeray’s statement that he had no problems with the National Population Register (NPR) and that nobody should be afraid over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The Sena’s stand appeared at variance with that of the NCP and the Congress. Pawar said the MVA has a decentralised decision-making process. “If any important decision is to be taken when it comes to the Sena that it is done in Maharashtra. When it comes to the Congress one has to go to Delhi. If a decision- making process is localised, it is more effective,” Pawar said when asked about the difference in the work culture between the Sena and the Congress. He said the Congress has now adopted a stand that the alliance has to work. “We all have agreed to the Common Minimum Programme (CMP). So, the Congress has resolved to follow the CMP-based decisions and make the alliance work,” Pawar said. When asked about MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s attempts to grow closer to the BJP, Pawar said, “Maharashtra needs an aggressive opposition right now. It remains to be seen who will take that role, whether it is the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena or the BJP. “The MNS has a strong appeal in Maharashtra. People are keen to hear Raj Thackeray’s opinion on various issues. However, why this appeal does not translate to votes needs to be studied,” he said.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI:: Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said that American President Donald Trump’s visit will not make India a superpower and the country needs human resources along with capital investment. “US President Donald Trump is coming to India in a few days, but how is that going to make us a superpower? Along with capital investment, we need human resource as well,” Thackeray said at a book launch event in Mumbai on Saturday. NCP chief Sharad Pawar, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and renowned lyricist Javed Akhtar also attended the event. Thackeray also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, without mentioning his name, during the course of his speech by using the context of the book, which is a collection of letters written by former Maharashtra Chief Minister late Abdul Rahman Antule to his wife. “The letters are written from the heart and there is a lot of difference between ‘Mann Ki Baat’ and ‘Dil ki baat’ which come straight from the heart,” Uddhav said. President Trump and US First Lady Melania Trump will visit India on February 24 and 25. On his first day, he will visit Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state Gujarat and take part in a road show with Prime Minister. He will also address the “Namaste Trump” event in Ahmedabad',\n",

The AIMIM leader said that he was being portrayed as being anti-Indian and anti-Hindu for the past couple of days. “I want to say that my earlier statement was basically against people who are members of organisations like RSS, BJP, Bajrang Dal, etc. These 100 are those people who want to divide this beautiful nation,” he added. On February 20, while addressing an anti-CAA rally, at Kalaburagi in Karnataka, Pathan had said, “time has now come for us to unite and achieve freedom. Remember we are 15 crore but can dominate over 100 crores.” “They tell us that we have kept our women in the front – only the lionesses have come out and you are already sweating. You can understand what would happen if all of us come together,” he had said.',\n",
       " 'GUWAHATI: Nearly six months after the publication of the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, the state coordinator of the exercise has indicated that a few names of “ineligible persons” were present in the list and that he has written to officials of all 31 districts seeking details of such people. In an official letter dated February 19 to all Deputy Commissioners (DC) and District Registrar of Citizen Registration (DRCR) under the subject ‘Regarding presence of ineligible persons in the final NRC’, NRC State Coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma said the matter was of utmost importance as the details have to be submitted to the Registrar General of India urgently. “With respect to the subject cited and the correspondences under reference, it has come to the knowledge of the undersigned that after publication of final NRC on 31st August 2019, a few names of ineligible persons are found present in the final NRC, particularly who are DV (Doubtful Voters), DF (Declared Foreigner), PFT (those with cases pending in Foreigners’ Tribunal), DVD (descendants of DV), DFD (descendants of FD) And PFTD (cases of declared foreigners pending in foreigner tribunals),” said Sarma. “A list of such persons has already been shared from your end through the medium mentioned at sl. 2 above (webform). “As such, you are requested to share the details of such persons who are ineligible for inclusion in NRC but whose names got included in NRC in addition to the list shared earlier…,” the letter said, directing that the responses be given by February 20. The letter came days after a police complaint was lodged against former Coordinator of the NRC in Assam Prateek Hajela for allegedly tampering with records related to the citizenship exercise, sources said on Friday. The complaint was lodged by an NGO Assam Public Works, the original petitioner to the Supreme Court about the NRC updation. Over 19 lakh people in Assam were left out of the final NRC list, which named 3,11,21,004 people as Indian citizens. The citizens’ registry was released online ending six years of speculation over the mammoth exercise involving 52,000 state government officials working on it for identifying illegal foreigners living in Assam. The NRC has immense significance for the people of the northeastern state which witnessed a six-year-long movement from 1979 to 1985 seeking detection and deportation of illegal Bangladeshis. The movement finally led to the Assam Accord of 1985 signed by the then Congress-ruled Centre in the presence of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the leaders of the agitation belonging to the All Assam Students Union and All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad. The NRC updation process, started in the state on orders of the Supreme Court in 2013, was carried out by the Registrar General of India under the monitoring of the apex judiciary.',\n",

We oppose Trump’s visit to the country,” he said. Speaking about BJP-led government at the Centre, he said, “The country’s economy has weakened ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power. Unemployment has seen a drastic increase during his tenure.” Raja also asked the Centre why it was sending citizens protesting against the NPR, CAA, and NRC behind bars. He welcomed Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s decision to pass a resolution against the CAA recently. “PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are moving forward with their Hindutva agenda. We should come together to protect the democratic values of our country,” he said. CPI State general secretary Chada Venkat Reddy and other leaders were present in the event.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The United States appeared to blame the Make in India push by India as the main reason why there is a delay in a trade deal between the two countries. There was much speculation that a deal would be signed when US President Donald Trump visits India on February 24-25 but the prospects appear to be negligible now.  “Trade talks will continue, but new Indian tariff proposals aimed at strengthening the country’s Make in India domestic manufacturing push have made them more difficult,” a senior White House administration official said in Washington on Friday. The official said US concerns which led to Washington suspending tariff-free access to exports worth $5.6 billion under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) still exist.  “We will be discussing those concerns and what we see an increase in barriers not a decrease. This will certainly come up among the leaders. We do want to make sure that we get this balance right. We want to address a lot of concerns and we’re not quite there yet,” the official said.  The expectations of even a mini-trade deal faded after it was announced that US Trade Representative Robert Lightizer would not be a part of the 12-member delegation accompanying the US President. Hiccups remain amid bonhomie over Don’s visit ACCORDING to Indo-US trade experts, Trump’s visit comes at time when ties saw some friction due to India’s purchase of a Russian missile system. “Even the announcements on new import tariffs on medical devices, walnuts, toys and electronics did not go down well with Washington. The move was aimed to reduce imports from China but did not augur well with the US,” said a researcher at the Indian Council for World Affairs. “The Make in India push of the Indian government, as I noted, has made the protectionism concerns even more of a concern to us. We have seen India’s budget process recently used to raise tariffs on products of interest in the United States. We continue to see important divergences on e-commerce and digital trade. So it’s a pretty wide scope, frankly, of important service and goods access barriers that we need to address,” he said.',\n",

The women, carrying the national tricolour and raising slogans of ‘aazadi’, said they would not move from the site till the Centre revoke Citizenship (Amendment) Act. They also tied a blue band on their arm and also raised ‘Jai Bhim’ slogans. There was heavy security deployment, including women police personnel, in the area. The women have blocked road No.66 which connects Seelampur to Maujpur and Yamuna Vihar. Traffic was also blocked due to the sudden protest at the site.

Dozens of politicians, including three former chief ministers — Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah of National Conference (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) — were placed under preventive detention soon after the Modi government reorganized and bifurcated Jammu and Kashmir state into two Union Territories on August 5 last year. Though most of the politicians have been released since then, the three chief ministers and a dozen politicians remain detained. While Farooq Abdullah was booked under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) in September, Omar and Mehbooba were also recently detained under the same law. The government cited their provocative statements and threats issued before the nullification of Article 370 of the Indian constitution which granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir state. In an exclusive interview to IANS on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, “Kashmir has been peaceful. The situation is improving rapidly. Along with the improvement, these decisions (release of politicians from detention) will also be finalized. The government has not tortured anyone.” Defending the government’s decision, the Defence Minister said that certain steps had been taken in the interests of Kashmir. “Everybody should welcome it,” he said. Singh said he will pray for the early release of the Abdullahs and Mufti from their detention. “I also pray that once they are out, they work and contribute towards improvement of the situation in Kashmir,” the Union Minister said.

He will raise these issues, particularly the religious freedom issue, which is extremely important to this administration,” a senior White House official said in response to a question on whether Trump will raise the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act or the National Register of Citizens during his meeting with Modi.  Recalling how Modi spoke of inclusiveness after last year’s poll victory, the official said the world looks to India to maintain religious liberty and equal treatment of all. In the recent past, two city councils in the US — Seattle and Cambridge — had passed resolutions against the CAA saying it was discriminatory in nature. Ahead of Trump’s visit, The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan US federal entity, published a ‘factsheet’ claiming the CAA “represents a significant downturn in religious freedom”.  India’s position is the CAA is an internal matter and the goal is to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries.  In 2015, the then US President Barack Obama at a speech in Siri Fort auditorium in Delhi had said India would succeed only if it is not splintered on religious lines.',\n",

       " 'GUWAHATI: As expected, former Assam student leader Pramod Bodo has joined the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL).  The 44-year-old had resigned as the president of All Bodo Students’ Union just days after the signing of historic third Bodo peace accord where he was among the signatories along with leaders of four factions of erstwhile insurgent group National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB).  His joining the UPPL, a party headed by former Rajya Sabha member UG Brahma, ahead of April elections to the autonomous Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), is likely to give a new dimension to Bodo politics.  Given his massive popularity among people, particularly Bodo youth, the UPPL appointed him as its working president immediately after he had joined the party late Friday evening.  The UPPL has always been there in the BTC poll scene but it could never throw up a challenge to former rebel leader-turned-politician Hagrama Mohilary-led Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) which has been in power in the BTC ever since its creation in 2003 in the aftermath of the Centre’s signing of second Bodo peace accord with erstwhile insurgent group Bodo Liberation Tigers.  This election, however, the BPF is likely to face a contest from the UPPL. Among reasons are anti-incumbency and Pramod’s joining the party. The four NDFB factions are also likely to participate in the polls but they have kept their cards close their chests. If they lend their support to the UPPL, it will only compound the BPF’s problems.  The BJP, which heads Assam’s three-party ruling coalition and is an ally of the BPF, is weighing its options. It has already indicated that it will go either with the BPF or the new party. Speculations were rife recently that the NDFB factions and Pramod will float a party. It appears distant now.  Pramod said the UPPL would decide on its election-centric alignment at the two-day convention of the party which got under way on Friday.  “Our aim is to ensure the implementation of all clauses of the third Bodo peace accord. We firmly believe that their implementation will establish permanent peace and stability in Bodo areas and bring in development in all spheres of life,” he said.  For over ten years, Pramod had led a democratic movement to secure a separate Bodoland state.',\n",

The combination of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers will create a pan-India tower company with over 163,000 towers, operating across all 22 telecom service areas. The combined entity will be the largest tower company in the world outside China. “FDI approval for merger of Indus Towers with Bharti Infratel has been received late evening yesterday,” Bharti Infratel said in a regulatory filing. It added that the board of directors of the company will meet on February 24, 2020 to “take stock and decide the future course of action”. Bharti Infratel and Vodafone hold 42 per cent stake each in Indus. Vodafone Idea holds 11.15 per cent stake in the mobile tower firm. As per the plans, the combined company, which would fully own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, would change its name to Indus Towers Ltd and will continue to be listed on Indian stock exchanges. The timely completion of the tower deal was critical for the companies, since it would allow Bharti and Vodafone Idea in offloading stake and raising funds. The development comes at a time when Vodafone Idea is confronted with total AGR dues of over Rs 53,000 crore. Of this, it has paid only Rs 3,500 crore in two tranches earlier this week. In all, as many as 15 entities owe the government Rs 1.47 lakh crore — Rs 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges. These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.',\n",

       " 'A group of more than 100 different diseases, cancer is one of the most severe health conditions. Cancer begins when the genetic changes interfere with the orderly process of cell division in your body and cause the cells to grow uncontrollably and develops a mass called a tumour. A tumour can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumour is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumour means the tumour can grow but will not spread. Some types of cancer do not form a tumour. These include leukaemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma [1]. The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis reached nearly 14.5 million in 2014 and it is expected to rise to almost 19 million by 2024 [2]. Cancer is such a disease which has led to many deaths worldwide, and the number of new cancer cases will rise to 22 million within the next two decades [3]. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in recent years. Around one-third of deaths from cancer are due to certain behavioural and dietary risks, which include a high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco and too much alcohol [4][5]. Let us have a look at some of the dangerous habits that can cause cancer apart from smoking – as we all know the way this habit can affect your overall health and increase the risk of cancer. 1. Drinking Too Much Alcohol Alcohol consumption has been shown to increase cancer risk. Several studies have pointed out that drinking alcohol twice a day can increase the risk of oesophagus cancer, colon cancer, rectum cancer and breast cancer [6]. Alcohol promotes the production of stomach acids that can harm the lining of the gastrointestinal tract as well [7]. 2. Using Air Fresheners Air fresheners have become essential home-care products and have replaced good old cleaning routines and traditional potpourris. These air fresheners do not improve the quality of air in any way, they just mask the foul odour, giving you a false sense of sanitation. They contain harmful cancer-causing substances that enter through the nostrils when you spray it around you and increase the risk of cancer [8][9]. 3. Exposure To Car Fumes People who are regularly exposed to diesel fuels (drivers, mechanics etc.) have a high risk of developing lung cancer and other respiratory ailments. Diesel and petrol (gasoline) release toxic carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, including benzene [10]. 4. Eating Burnt Food When you grill food items like fish, chicken and meat, they become slightly burnt and some areas become blackened. Though this gives a smoky flavour, the compounds such as heterocyclic amines and so-called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can increase the risk of stomach, colon and pancreatic cancers [11]. 5. Eating Canned Foods Canned foods are unhealthy and dangerous because the foods are sealed in metal containers lined with a plastic coating that is full of harmful chemicals. These canned foods when consumed leads to hormonal disturbances and DNA changes that can increase the risk of breast cancer [12]. 6. Drinking Diet Soda Recent studies have pointed out that many of the common soda brands contain high levels of 4-methylimidazole (4-MI), a known animal carcinogen [13]. Diet soda contains artificial sweeteners that have been linked to increasing pancreatic cancer and other types of cancers. Several studies have shown that diet soda also leads to bladder cancer and brain tumours [14][15]. 7. Using Sunscreen To prevent skin cancer and other skin damages, most people use sunscreen. But you will be shocked to know that sunscreens contain an ingredient called zinc oxide, which is known to produce free radicals that can cause DNA damage and trigger cancer cell growth [16]. 8. Using Scented Candles Recent studies have said that the fumes released from paraffin wax contain carcinogens and other fossil fuel components [17]. The paraffin wax candles may pose to be a killer if you regularly go for candle-lit dinners. Instead, burn pure beeswax candles, as it will not damage your body [18]. Burning incense can also trigger cancer risk. 9. Engaging In Oral Sex According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, it was reported that the rising rate of oropharyngeal cancers is caused by HPV infection acquired from oral to genital contact [19]. The study also pointed out that having six or more oral sex partners can increase the risk. 10. Working The Night Shift Yes, this too can increase the risk of cancer. According to the study published in the British Medical Journal, working the graveyard shift can increase a person’s risk of breast cancer, most likely due to melatonin suppression [20].',\n",

       " 'MANCHESTER: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says clubs “tremble” when Real Madrid or Barcelona come calling after Raheem Sterling created a stir by expressing his admiration for Real. The 25-year-old England international, who is under contract at the Etihad until 2023, described the 13-time European champions as a “fantastic club” in an interview with Madrid-based sports daily AS. The forward was photographed with a City shirt on one shoulder and a Madrid shirt on the other. City and Real meet in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at the Bernabeu Stadium next week, so the timing of Sterling’s interview has raised eyebrows. Sterling is one of City’s key assets and his future could be up in the air if the club fail in their appeal against a two-year ban from European competitions for breaching UEFA’s financial fair play rules. Guardiola said Real and Barca, the club he used to play for and manage, were true giants of the European game. “All the clubs have to know that when Real Madrid or Barcelona knock on the door the other clubs must tremble,” he said on Friday. “They will be in a little bit of trouble. “Barcelona and Real Madrid are maybe the strongest and most powerful teams in terms of their history and how good they are. That is normal and I understand completely.” But the City manager is not concerned about Sterling’s head being turned. The player, who is recovering from a hamstring injury and is unlikely to feature in Saturday’s Premier League match at Leicester, has emerged as one of Guardiola’s key players during his four seasons in charge in Manchester. Sterling ‘one of the best’ “You just see the commitment from Raheem every single day when he arrives,” he said. “His commitment is there in every game, offensively and defensively, so he’s one of the best players in the world and it’s normal that big clubs see his desire for the team. “I don’t know if Madrid or Barcelona call his agent, but I don’t have any doubts about his commitment from the first day to the last day that Raheem and other ones have had and will have until the end.” Guardiola, whose second-placed side are 22 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool, has also reaffirmed his own desire to remain at City. “I’m working with exceptional players especially, and I have the feeling that they follow us 100 percent,” he said. “I know how it’s not easy working with us and with me, but I’m happy.

       " 'CHENNAI: Poonam Yadav could be dismissed as a young girl on the field. All of four-foot-eleven, she is not among the taller members of the squad. Playing against Australians, with an average height over five-foot-six, only made her look smaller. However clichéd it may sound, looks are deceptive. The Aussies learnt the hard way in the first World T20 match in Sydney on Friday. Plundering runs with elan, the hosts were expected to overhaul India’s modest target of 133 in no time. Not until Poonam stepped in with her lazy loopy leg-spinners, turning either way without fuss. Her staggering figure of 4/19 helped India win by 17 runs. What more, she was even on a hat-trick. Miles away in Agra, Poonam’s childhood coach Manoj Singh was glued to the TV set following her each move. He still recollects how she turned her disadvantage into a weapon. “Many people might think that short height has its own disadvantages and some might even consider it as a weakness,” said Singh from Agra. “But not Poonam. She turned it into her strength. When you are of that height, you need to provide a good flight to make the ball travel. That (flight) has become her weapon now. Today (Friday) when she bowled those wrong’uns, Australian batters couldn’t read it.” The leg-spinner used her weapon, googly, judiciously and bamboozled the defending champions. Though she was introduced into the attack after nine overs, the 24 deliveries that she bowled were enough for India. From 67/2, Australia lost a flurry of wickets to eventually bundle out for 115.',\n",

The design and the software used for ledger communication has already been completed. We are expecting to launch it by January 2021,” said Jithin.  One of the reasons for launching the project according to Jithin, is to enable private enterprises to share their data through a secure network. The existing blockchain communication channel requires companies to use the internet which does not satisfy their security needs. Another limitation is the low internet connectivity in rural areas, especially in North India. The hardware parts of the satellite will be supplied by DI Invest, a company based in Switzerland on a contract basis. From a business point of view, executing the mission successfully would also help Jithin in popularising blockchain technology among enterprises and other financial institutions in the country and specifically in Thiruvananthapuram.',\n",

President Trump and First Lady Melania are scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi on February 24 and 25. “I’m going to India next week and we’re talking trade. They’ve been hitting us very hard for many, many years,” Trump said at a ‘Keep America Great’ rally in Colorado on Thursday. Trump told thousands of his supporters that he “really likes” Prime Minister Modi and they would be talking business. “We’ve got to talk a little…We’ve got to talk a little business. It’s been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs, one the highest in the world is India,” he said. Ahead of Trump’s visit, there have been reports on India and the US agreeing on a trade package as a precursor to a major trade deal. Downplaying the expectation of a trade deal with India during his visit, Trump said the two countries could make a “tremendous” trade deal, but indicated that the talks on this might slow down if he did not get a good deal. “We’re going to India, and we may make a tremendous deal there,” Trump said in his commencement address at the Hope for Prisoners Graduation Ceremony in Las Vegas on Thursday. “Maybe we’ll slow down. We’ll do it after the election. I think that could happen too. So, we’ll see what happens,” he said. “But we’re only making deals if they’re good deals because we’re putting America first. Whether people like it or not, we’re putting America first,” Trump said. The bilateral India-US trade in goods and services is about three per cent of the US’ world trade. Trump spoke about his India visit at the Colorado rally and the grand welcome he is expected to get in the country. “I hear, they are going to have 10 million people.

       " 'CODOGNO (Italy): Italy reported its first death from the new virus from China early Saturday and the number of people infected more than quadrupled due to a cluster of cases that prompted officials to order schools, restaurants and businesses to close. State-run RAI television reported a 78-year-old man, one of two people in northern Veneto region to have been infected, died Friday. Italian news agencies ANSA and LaPresse also reported the death, citing the Veneto regional president, Luca Zaia. In Lombardy, at least 14 new cases were confirmed, representing the first infections in Italy acquired through secondary contagion and bringing the country’s total to 19. The cluster was located in a handful of tiny towns southeast of Milan, said Lombardy regional health chief Giulio Gallera. “This was foreseeable even if we hoped it wouldn’t have happened,” Gallera said. The first to fall ill was a 38-year-old Italian who met with someone who had returned from China on Jan. 21 without presenting any symptoms of the new virus, health authorities said. That person was being kept in isolation and appears to present antibodies to the virus. The 38-year-old is now hospitalized in critical condition. His wife and a friend of his, who was a member of his running club, also tested positive for the virus. Three patients at the hospital in Codogno where he went with flu-like symptoms on Feb. 18 also have infections, as do five nurses and doctors. In addition, another three elderly people, who frequented the same cafe as the runner’s father, also tested positive Friday, Gallera said. Tests were underway, meanwhile, on the 38-year-old’s doctor, who made a house call on him, as well as on 120 people he worked within the research and development branch of Unilever in Casalpusterlengo, Gallera said. Word of the contagion sparked fears throughout the region, particularly given the closure of the emergency room at the Codogno hospital. “We are old and we are very concerned,” said 76-year-old Codogno resident Carmelo Falcone. “I live on my own. I really don’t know what to do.”',\n",

My homage to all those martyrs.” “We love all the languages including our mother tongue,” she said. International Mother Language Day is observed on February 21 to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism. The day was celebrated by various organisations and institutes across West Bengal.

BCCL officials claimed that coal fires may have been caused by lightning, forest fires, human accidents, and improper shutting down of old mines. It is understood that the fire started when the mines were owned by private parties, who used conventional techniques to dig out coal. “In a major achievement, underground fire has substantially decreased in Jharia.

Koshiyari turned down the proposal mooted by the state’s rural development department, seeking withdrawal of the practice of electing panchayat chiefs from among the people. Refusing to give his nod to the ordinance, the governor asked the government to get it cleared by the Assembly.

We’ll try to incorporate his suggestions during the Assembly session.” He claimed the development work has suffered in panchayats where his party does not have a majority. Earlier, Koshiyari refused to nominate two members, recommended by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), a partner in the ruling alliance, to the Legislative Council. Two NCP members were elected to the Assembly last year and their posts have been vacant since. “Now this is the second major decision turned down by the governor.

Recently, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in a recent release after the controversy broke, sought to absolve itself of any blame and said that they were following up on reports made by the State police that around 127 people had allegedly obtained Aadhar based on false pretences.   The question here is, how do the police come to the conclusion whether Aadhar has been obtained illegally? Privacy activists and data security researchers say: Cordon and search — apart from the instances of arrests made by police where they have said they were ‘acting on tip-offs’. “There are so many people in the city. How do the police get to know who has procured it illegally or not? They did it by doing cordon and search. This is a mode of surveillance police deploy which enables them to identify such,” Srinivas Kodali, a city-based independent security researcher said. SQ Masood, an activist, said, “Police has been separately asking for Aadhar during the operations. Not just that, citizens who visit restaurants at night are often stopped by police and asked for their Aadhar cards.” In recent times, the State police has conducted numerous such operations in the Old City area of the city, including in the Rohingya camp in Balapur. In such operations they ask them to show their identification cards, including Aadhar. Such a case came into the fore recently, when AIMIM Charminar MLA Mumtaz Ahmed Khan was caught in a video reprimanding the police who was in the Shakkar Gunj area conducting a cordon and search operation. This happened duing the initial days of anti-CAA-NRC-NPR protests and it had ticked off citizens in the area. In the video, Khan asked the police officers who claimed they were in the area to check vehicle ownership, “You are asking Aadhar card for that? Please leave. Do not do like this. Citizens are already confused and worried due to NRC.” However, how legal is this whole process? Not much, according to experts. Kodali said, “This is obviously not legal. The city police, despite being asked, is unable to furnish the sections under which they conduct cordon and search.” Even AIMIM chief Asaduddin OWaisi too had recently said, “@TelanganaPolice please stop asking for Aadhaar during your “search & cordon” operations.

Here’s my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn’t get in. It’s going to look like peanuts from now on,” he said. “I’ll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied when we fill up like a 60,000-seat stadium? I am getting spoiled,” Trump said. One of Trump’s supporters from the audience then suggested that he build a bigger stadium.',\n",
       " 'HYDERABAD:  The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is divided, yet united. During its meeting early this month, the country’s six chief inflation-nutters unanimously agreed to keep repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent, but differed if growth revival from here on needs a monetary or fiscal push. While the MPC broadly believes it has policy headroom, three members expect structural reforms to aid recovery before they can take the pedal off policy rates. In essence, as Michael Patra observed, the panel ‘entered a tunnel of testing trade-offs’ (inflation vs growth) and ‘the light at the end of it won’t be seen for some time to come’. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das maintained that macro-economy needs further monetary stimulus, though wants to time it optimally. But external member and known hawk Chetan Ghate sees no space for rate cuts. According to Ghate, Budget 2020 offered a combined tax stimulus (including corporate and income tax cuts) of 1.2 per cent of GDP. “If growth hasn’t revived with a 135 bps cuts in the policy rate and a tax stimulus amounting to 1.2 per cent of GDP, then the need of the hour is more structural reform,” he said. Echoing Ghate, Janak Raj believes, the need is to step up investment and improve productivity through further structural reforms. Ravindra H Dholakia too concluded that long-term growth revival depends critically on fiscal policy and structural reforms. He merely shot down Budget 2020 saying it won’t aid immediate growth recovery as the measures were pro-cyclical against the needed counter-cyclical boost.According to him, the FY20 fiscal slippage of 41 bps includes 36 bps due to cyclical factors while only 5 bps was genuine fiscal slippage. “In a year of a serious growth slowdown, such an adherence to ‘fiscal discipline’ not only shows misplaced emphasis and unjustified concerns but also a contractionary fiscal policy,” he reasoned. Despite intense efforts, inflation trajectory remains uncertain, though the MPC hopes the recent price spike will subside in future. Food inflation, including onion’s abnormal price behaviour besides others will be carefully monitored. The panel had an ancillary concern in Coronavirus, besides risks of global growth and fluctuating crude prices.',\n",

       " 'ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is likely to get four months to fulfil requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and secure an exit from its grey list. A decision to this effect was likely to be taken by the FATF on Friday after the conclusion of the February 16-21 group meetings and plenary in Paris. The Pakistani delegation to the meetings was led by Revenue Minister Hammad Azhar. The FATF in October decided to keep Pakistan on its ‘Grey’ list for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and others. If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran. According to a report in the Dawn newspaper, the international terror financing watchdog was set to give Pakistan time till June 2020 to achieve full compliance with its 27-point action plan and secure exit from the FATF grey list. Sources from Paris said that Pakistan was found fully or close to fully compliant on more than half of the 27 targets. “We are satisfied with the progress so far. There was no case at all for blacklisting us,” a source was quoted as saying in the report. Pakistan is already finalising major amendments to at least a dozen of its laws to meet the FATF requirements by June this year. Based on that, the country’s performance would be judged in the next FATF plenary in October 2020, the report said. Pakistan submitted a 650-page review report to the FATF on January 8. The report was submitted in response to 150 questions raised by the FATF regarding new Pakistani policies on money laundering. The report outlined the steps taken by Pakistan between October 2019 to January 2020 to implement the group’s recommendations. In January, Pakistan urged the US to support its bid to exit from FATF’s grey list ahead of a key meeting of the international terror financing watchdog in Beijing in which Islamabad’s efforts to adopt stricter laws against terror financing and money laundering were scrutinised.',\n",

Amulya Leona had raised “Pakistan Zindabad” slogan thrice after the organisers of the event under the banner of “Save Constitution” invited her to address the gathering in the presence of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi. A sedition case was also filed against her. “Importantly, the organisations that are behind people like Amulya and nurturing them, if we don’t take action against such organisations, such things won’t end. “Prima facie it is clear that there is conspiracy going on to disturb law and order with such incidents,” Yediyurappa said. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, he said, “if organisations that are behind her are inquired into, things will come out. It is clear that she had links with Naxals in the past. In this backdrop she should be punished and action should be taken against organisations that are behind here.” Amulya’s father himself has said she should be punished and should not get bail and that he will not seek protection for her, the chief minister added. Police will also be questioning the organisers of the event in connection with the incident, official sources said. Meanwhile, Amulya’s father Wazi said action should be taken against her in accordance with law, so that she corrects herself. “It is an unforgivable mistake, she has caused pain to Indians. I’m deeply disturbed. Action should be taken against her in accordance with law, she is around 19, we will have to find out why she said it and who is behind it,” he added. “She is a bright girl. I have tried to tell her not to involve herself in such activities after I got to know she was involving in anti-CAA, NRC protests and complete her education first,” he said. He expressed apprehension over possible health issues of his daughter. Police have provided security to Amulya’s residence at Koppa in Chikkamagaluru after some protesters had staged demonstrations, officials said. Several organisations held protests in the city on Friday against the incident.',\n",
       " 'Thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in your neck, which produces several hormones that have an impact on your metabolism function, hair growth, menstrual cycle and energy levels. When there is an abnormal production of thyroid hormones, thyroid problems occur. There are two types of thyroid disorder: hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. When the thyroid gland produces excess hormones it is called hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. 1. Go on a healthy diet A well-balanced diet which includes colourful fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants, low-fat dairy products and whole grains can help manage or prevent thyroid problems. Consuming foods rich in vitamin B12, such as peas, asparagus, sesame seeds, tuna, eggs, milk and cheese can help the thyroid gland to function properly. 2. Have gluten-free foods Thyroid disease is often accompanied by celiac disease because gluten when consumed damages the lining of the gut, which in turn, interferes with the hormones and causes inflammation that can affect your thyroid gland. If you have a thyroid disease, consume gluten-free foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, fresh meat, fish and poultry [1]. 3. Limit your sugar intake Excess sugar consumption is harmful if you have a thyroid disease because it leads to increased inflammation in the body. Thyroid produces two hormones triiodothyronine, known as T3 and thyroxine, known as T4. An increase in inflammation can slow down the conversion of the T4 hormone to T3 hormone and this can worsen the symptoms of thyroid disease [2]. 4. Eat probiotic-rich foods Many gastrointestinal symptoms occur due to hypothyroidism. Therefore, eating probiotic foods such as yogurt, cheese, kefir and kombucha that contain active bacteria can help keep your stomach and intestines healthy. 5. Consume selenium-rich foods Selenium is an important mineral that plays a vital role in thyroid hormone metabolism and it has been shown to help balance the thyroxine or T4 hormone. Eat selenium-rich foods such as turkey, Brazil nuts, tuna and grass-fed beef [3]. 6. Eat iodine-rich foods Iodine is another essential mineral used by the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones that helps control many important body functions. When the body does not have enough iodine, it can’t produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to hypothyroidism. Consume foods rich in iodine like shrimp, seaweed, oysters, yogurt and cheese [3]. 7. Have iron-rich foods Iron is an essential mineral required for thyroid hormone metabolism. A deficiency in iron can impair the synthesis of thyroid hormones leading to thyroid problems [3]. 8. Reduce stress Chronic stress triggers the dysfunction of thyroid hormones and if you already have thyroid it can make your thyroid symptoms worse. So, in order to avoid stress try a few relaxation exercises. 9. Practice yoga and meditation Yoga and mediation can help manage thyroid disorders by improving the blood flow to your thyroid gland as well as relaxes the mind and body at the same time. 10. Try acupuncture Acupuncture is an age-old healing practice used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is known to balance your thyroid hormones because acupuncture helps relieve muscle tension, stress and anxiety in people suffering from thyroid [4].',\n",

       " 'Verizon is expected to stop selling Pixel smartphones starting from the Pixel 4A. A source claims that it is due to the lukewarm Pixel series sales that one of the top-tier carriers (Verizon) stood on backfoot. To get huge attention for smartphones, makers make a tie with some key carriers. But, having lost Verizon, Google’s keen interest in manufacturing smartphones could be on a setback. With an announcement by Verizon, Google’s next Pixel 5 which was officially teased recently, seems to be on hold. It could be that after losing highly reputed carrier Google will not launch the phone with other models. The announcement came after Verizon learned tepid sales of the Pixel 4 series. Keeping robust revenues in mind, the U.S. carrier doesn’t want to lose its stake over the Pixel phones’ debacle. It was until the Pixel 3A series things were good. The 3A series phones received good responses from consumers, as the phones offered Stock Android which was the latest at that time, incredible working camera, and quick updates with security patches. These phones brought good fortunes, but again it was Verizon that wasn’t satisfied over the sales. So, we can say it was from the Pixel 3A onwards that Verizon had been planning for a call-off from selling the upcoming Pixel handsets. It is not just the diminishing sales figure of these phones but also the giant has been lagging far behind from Samsung and Apple, in the premium category. While Samsung and Apple each time brings new specs and cool-looking design, Pixel phones don’t produce enough attraction amongst consumers. Exceptionally, Samsung has taken a big and bold step towards designing clamshell phones, and two of its foldable phones are already available in the market. Such a creativity Google lacks. Even though it might have plans for launching the foldable phones, it will now keep this idea on hold until things turn Google’s way.',\n",

The Proteas – captained by Quinton de Kock – take on Australia, who host the Twenty20 World Cup later in 2020, in three T20Is and three ODIs, starting on Friday (February 21) in Johannesburg. In an ill-tempered 2018 Test series against South Africa, Warner was suspended, along with Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft, for his involvement in the tourists’ ball-tampering scandal. However, Warner, who also became embroiled in sledging matches with South Africa fans, does not feel tempers will flare once again this time around. He reasons that, due to the short and sweet nature of the tour, there is not enough time for the teams to forge a rivalry. “It’s one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket and you don’t really have much time over the short period of the time to get underneath each other’s skin or anything like that,” Warner told reporters. “And you don’t go out there to do that.

       " 'Piraeus (Greece), February 21: Alexandre Lacazette scored a late winner to secure Arsenal a 1-0 win at Olympiacos and hand the Gunners a significant advantage in their Europa League last-32 tie. Mikel Arteta’s men looked to be heading for an underwhelming goalless draw in Piraeus, but Lacazette struck nine minutes from time to get Arsenal a potentially vital away goal ahead of the return leg in London. The Gunners had little difficulty taking control and should have netted early on when Lacazette was guilty of a dreadful miss, and the visitors failed to craft a better opportunity until late on. Olympiacos generally appeared happy to hold on for a stalemate, but that approach backfired when Lacazette turned in Bukayo Saka’s pass, putting Arsenal in complete control of the tie. After surviving an early scare when Bernd Leno denied Mathieu Valbuena, Lacazette missed a glorious chance for the Gunners, somehow shooting wide from about eight yards having been teed up by Gabriel Martinelli. Leno had to be alert again a few moments later, making a reaction save after Giorgos Masouras’ cross was deflected goalwards by David Luiz. A second opportunity came Lacazette’s way just before the break, but Ousseynou Ba crucially got a touch to divert his fierce volley over the crossbar. The contest became a cagier affair after the break, with Arsenal controlling possession but doing little to hurt an Olympiacos side seemingly content to absorb pressure. But Arsenal finally produced some spark in attack through Saka in the 81st minute, the 18-year-old talent driving at the defence and feeding Lacazette, who tapped in from close range. Sokratis Papastathopoulos almost doubled Arsenal’s advantage when his late header came back off the crossbar.',\n",
       " 'Glasgow, February 21: Rangers superbly came from behind to win 3-2 at home against Braga in the first leg of their last-32 tie after Fransergio scored a contender for the best goal of this season’s Europa League. Fransergio and Abel Ruiz struck either side of half-time to put the Portuguese side, who were unbeaten in 13 European matches, in complete control at Ibrox on Thursday (February 20). But Ianis Hagi got one back for Steven Gerrard’s side and, with 15 minutes to go, Joe Aribo danced through the Braga defence to slot home and level it up. Hagi’s free-kick then deflected off the wall to wrongfoot goalkeeper Matheus and complete an improbable comeback in front of a raucous crowd in Glasgow. Braga started brilliantly, with Wallace missing a header from three yards and Francisco Trincao – who will join Barcelona in July for €31million – rifling just wide. Fransergio then stunned the home fans with a beauty from over 30 yards out, his rocket of a strike clipping the underside of the crossbar to open the scoring in the 11th minute. Matheus denied the competition’s top scorer Alfredo Morelos twice in quick succession, but Trincao was running the show and he almost made it 2-0, a cute curling effort not quite bending enough. Fransergio almost repeated his wondergoal after the interval, but this time his effort hit the top of the crossbar, with livewire Morelos then denied by a goal-line clearance from the alert Bruno Viana. Debutant Ruiz, who joined from Barcelona last month, doubled Braga’s lead with an excellent finish, but Hagi reduced the deficit with a left-footed strike from just inside the box that went in off the post. The quality did not let up as Aribo equalised with a superb solo effort and, though Braga have a brace of away goals to take into next week’s return leg, momentum is with Rangers after Hagi’s fortuitous set-piece wrapped up the scoring.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: The coronavirus epidemic that has stalled large parts of China, if not contained quickly will jeopardise many domestic sectors which are heavily dependent on Chinese inputs warn analysts at Crisil. In terms of shipments from China, imports of solar panels stand at 75 per cent, bulk drugs ingredients 69 per cent, electronics 67 per cent and consumer durables 45 per cent being the worst hit. The epidemic has already killed over 2,110 in China alone and infected close to 75,000 there, as 60 million Chinese are suffering from Beijing-ordered shutdown across more than two dozen cities. However, though dependence is low in percentage terms, the consumer durables industry will be in trouble as neither it has the inventory nor the legroom to ramp up capacity in short time. “Inventory days for consumer durables are typically around two months. Hence, with the virus outbreak, the impact will begin to be visible in March-marked by inventory rundown, leading to negative impact by end of the current quarter, and a possible price hike.” India imports 45 per cent completely built units of consumer durables from China. While consumer durables sector is worth Rs 76,300 crore, it imports from China is 45 per cent. The country’s total merchandise imports were USD 484 billion in 2019 of which 18 per cent or USD 85 billion were from China, and India remains a net importer from China. Since the country lacks the capability to produce complex components electronics sector worth Rs 5.3 lakh crore will be hit of the Chinese shutdown lasts longer as domestic players do not have the capability to manufacture such semiconductors and components in the short term. Of the Rs 5,30,000 crore market, exports are only 6 per cent, while imports are 31 per cent of which 67 per cent is from China. However, the steel sector has capacity headroom to absorb lack of imports and can even open up exports opportunity. Stating that dark days await solar energy market as 75 per cent of panels come from China, which also controls 80 per cent of the global supplies. On pharma, it said with 69 per cent of its total pharma bulk drugs intermediates coming in from China, the sector will be hit if supplies don’t resume by April. Terming the impact of the epidemic on India, whose Exim trade with China is worth USD 115 billion in 2019, a report by Crisil on Thursday said it could be a mixed bag in the base case scenario of the virus finding its way out by next month as the winter fades and the summer sets in. “With the weather getting warmer over the next two months, we expect the epidemic to subside in China by April. That is the base case. In the worst case, the epidemic may well extend through the first quarter of fiscal 2021, intensifying the severity of impact.” “If not contained quickly, it will have a knock-on effect in the world economy and disrupt global supply chains,” Crisil analysts warned. As much as 18 per cent of auto components come from China and 30 per cent of tyre imports also are from China. Again 45 per cent of completely built units of consumer durables come from China and 67 per cent of electronic components come from China. While India exports 36 per cent of diamonds to China and China sources 38 per cent of leather from India; and when it comes to petrochemicals exports, 34 per cent is shipped to China. China accounts for 22 per cent of seafood exports too. China supplies 17 per cent of imported paper and 69 per cent of total pharma bulk drugs intermediates come from China and 44 per cent of total plastics imports are Chinese while 17 per cent of steel imports are also from China. India exports 27 per cent of total cotton yarn to China and 37 per cent of ceramic tiles are imported from China. It can be noted that China contributes 16 per cent of global GDP and trade, and consumes a fifth of world’s metals and supplies 40 per cent of global apparel and textile trade. China also controls a whopping 80 per cent of the global solar panels market, and accounts for 70-75 per cent of global iron ore trade, 20-25 per cent of coal trade and 25-30 per cent of crude. “A delay beyond two-three months due to continued low production or an extended lockdown would impact domestic corporates much more severely,” they warned. “The fact is, other countries, including India, do not potentially have the scale or size to take material advantage of the opportunities available due to disruption in Chinese supplies. It can take significant resources and time to set up additional capacities, by which time China itself might re-commence production,” they said.',\n",

On Wednesday, the BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao had reportedly said that there seemed to be a connection emerging between the Congress’s idea of Hindu terror and LeT, ISI’s 26/11 strategy. “Was someone from India helping ISI as handler to give terrorists Hindu identity? Was Digvijaya Singh working as handler? Congress should answer this.” Also, BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya had tweeted an old video of Digvijaya Singh, in which Singh was seen blaming the RSS after the 26/11 attack. The 2008 Malegaon blast case accused and BJP MP from Bhopal, Pragya Singh Thakur, who had defeated Singh in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, too had said, “I have been saying that the script has been written. This is a conspiracy of the Congress. I was only made a pawn. It is true that they were the first to use the term Hindu terrorists in the wake of Malegaon blast in 2008. “Immediately after this attack, Digvijay Singh released a book called Hindu terrorism in which he said the 26/11 attack on Mumbai was done by Hindus and RSS.” Importantly, the saffron terror/Hindu terror debate has been reignited by the recently released autobiography of former Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria titled “Let Me Say It Now.” In the book, Maria has claimed that had Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Ajmal Kasab not been caught alive, the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack would have been portrayed by some sections of media to have been carried out by “Hindu” terrorists.',\n",
       " 'PATNA: The politics over the prohibition of alcohol in Bihar has started to gain momentum as the Assembly elections inches closer. After a challenge by HAM president and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on prohibition, RJD leader Tejashawi Yadav on Thursday openly challenged Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on it. Earlier, Jitan Ram Manjhi had said that despite the liquor ban in the state, bureaucrats and senior officials were consuming liquor freely. He had challenged Nitish Kumar to conduct breathalyzer tests on ministers and some bureaucrats, reality of prohibition would come to be known. Now, Tejashawi Yadav also politically attacked and challenged Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on prohibition. He said through a tweet: “I challenge CM Nitishji to do a random breathalyzer test of his near and dear drunkard leaders and bureaucrats on any given day. Test results will be the results of alcohol ban.” He asked Nitish Kumar to come and apologize for fooling the people on prohibition. “Come on Nitish Ji! Accept your failure or apologize for fooling the people. Your DGP has already accepted it,” he tweeted further. “Do we say more when the DGP himself admits that bootlegging is rampant in Bihar with the blessing of police, ruling politicians and administration? Prohibition remains a grandiose PR exercise by Nitishji. Unmasking has begun now,” he said. Earlier, Jitan Ram Manjhi had also advocated at a public rally that liquor should be consumed as medicine and he has accused the state government of targeting poor people in the name of prohibition. Recently, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar speaking a national conference in Delhi on ‘Liquor-Free Bharat’ had claimed that around 2.5 lakh people were arrested and 90 lakh liters of liquor were seized since April 5 in 2016 to 2019 by the police in Bihar. Spokesperson of JD-U Rajiv Ranjan Prasad contradicting Tejashawi Yadav’s statements said that the growing number of tourists only reinforces Nitish Kumar’s idea behind prohibition. “The prohibition has created healthy and happy Bihar free from the ill-effects of alcohol and propelling the rise of state economy higher every year,” he said.',\n",

Party leaders say Kishor doesn’t pose a challenge to the incumbent NDA government under chief minister Nitish Kumar. However, BJP is eager to bolster its organizational strength given that it has lost power in five states in 18 months and can’t take chances in Bihar in the poll likely to be held in October-November this year.

       " 'NEW DELHI:  The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has proposed four per cent hike in tariff for air navigation services.  AAI has said that the tariff has not seen much change in last many years and review is needed considering the technology upgradation and other factors. Earlier, prices were increased by 10% in December 2016 for both domestic and international tariff. However, the domestic tariff increase was rolled back in July 2017. Further increase of 5% was made in April 2017 for both domestic and international flights. This was later rolled back for domestic flights in July 2017. “Hence, in effect, for domestic flights, rates which were applicable in 2001 continue to be applied even after almost two decades,” said the authority in its consultation paper. “In line with the philosophy for determination of tariff for air navigation services, an increase of 4% in tariff for year 2020-21 and another increase of 4% in tariff for the year 2025-26 is proposed,” the AAI has said. The AAI has floated a consultation paper on the issue seeking suggestions and objections over the proposal. Highlighting the potential of the aviation sector, it said India is a nation of 1.35 billion people which has a middle-class population of over 350 million. “Around 700 million passengers must be flying per annum at conservative estimates and 2017-18 figure of 187 million passengers is a small fraction of the total potential. Hence, untapped potential in the Indian skies is large,” it said. It also said that the requirement of trained employees in air navigation center is on the rise. “AAI intends to recruit the personnel to meet the shortfall in the requirement vs availability of officers at the required levels. Hence, cost of all such additional employees to be recruited have also been considered in the projections for the 10 years.”',\n",

The Budget session will reconvene on March 2 and conclude on April 3.The second outreach by the government is likely to be a bigger and “more fruitful” exercise than the first visit made by 37 ministers in January, government officials said on Wednesday. They added that each minister will be assigned a different district, not to have any overlap like during the first visit. Focus this time will be on 10 districts of Kashmir, a source said. During the visit, the ministers are also expected to follow up on developments that would have occurred since the first batch of ministers visited.

They  submitted two sets of feedback — one on the initiatives taken by the Union Territory’s administration and the other on the Centre’s initiatives.  Sources said that the exact timeline of the visit is yet to be prepared but the visit is scheduled to take place after the Parliament session ends. “Since Parliament session is from March 2 to April 3, the visit is likely to be scheduled in April,” an official said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his office are likely to soon finalise the list of ministers for the visit, according to sources, who added that each minister will be assigned a different district. Therefore, no minister will have any direct contact with others. The district magistrate of each district will also give a detailed account of development works being done in the area to the minister concerned, another source explained.The ministers will also look at the rate of project implementation after the Union Budget. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced `30,757 crore for Jammu and Kashmir in the Budget.“They will follow up on certain schemes that were inaugurated earlier. A deadline was chalked out for developmental projects. The ministers will follow up on the progress.

       " 'NEW DELHI: TV prices are likely to go up by as much as 10 per cent from next month as disrupted supply of open-cell television panels – mostly imported from China – has resulted in a shortage of the key television component. TV panels, which account for nearly 60 per cent of the price of a TV unit, are mostly imported from China. While companies had stocked in advance for Chinese New Year break but Coronavirus outbreak has caused disruption in production and supply of many key components. Though some factories have re-opened but they are working with minimal staff. This, according to industry executives, has pushed prices of panels by almost 20 per cent. One of the executives said it would take at least one quarter for supply and production to return to normalcy, and so prices would also see an impact. “By March 2020, TV prices will be increased by 10 per cent due to the current Coronavirus crisis of China, there is a major shortage of raw materials along with a sharp 20 per cent increase in open-cell panel prices,” Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO of SPPL – which is the exclusive brand licensee of Thomson TVs in India – said. He added that in view of the current market scenario, there could be production loss of up to 30-50 per cent. Echoing similar views, Haier India President Eric Braganza said refrigerator and air conditioners prices could also increase in the coming weeks. “TV prices will go up by the beginning of March, and refrigerator and ACs will follow. Prices of deep freezers are already up by 2.5 per cent,” he said. Most companies import compressors for AC and refrigerators, from China. A joint report of by industry body CEAMA and Frost & Sullivan had forecast that TV market in India is expected to grow to 2.84 crore units in 2024-25 from 1.75 crore units in 2018-19. It had also noted that open-cell panel and chips used in making TVs are predominantly imported from China and other markets like Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, and only the last mile assembly is done in India. The Indian government had removed import duty on open cell panels used in production of TV sets to lower the cost and encourage local manufacturing, the report had said. Panasonic India and South Asia President and CEO Manish Sharma also foresees a hike in the TV prices as the cost of open-cell (TV panel) in China has gone up by around 3 per cent. “We already are witnessing panel price increase in China. From April onwards, prices could either remain where they are due to better efficiencies or may increase by 3-5 per cent if the current trend continues,” he said.

After the aerial survey, he met the officials and engineers involved in the project for discussion, review and analysis at Indo-Tibetan Border Police camp in Matli in Uttarkashi district. The state government officials informed the union minister that the work on 250 kms of the road has been completed while widening is going on for another 400 kms of the length of the roads. The work on the remaining 239kms is yet to start as the requisite environmental clearance yet to be granted.

       " 'Pregnancy changes the life of any woman. In more ways than one. In addition to preparing oneself mentally and emotionally to take care of another being, the process of pregnancy is in itself a journey unique to each woman. Every woman is different. While one woman might go through bouts of nausea during pregnancy, there might be another who does not feel squeamish in the least. Another common problem associated with pregnancy is that of back pain in general, and lower back pain in particular. In a study conducted on pregnant women, it was found that nearly 80% of the women in the study had back pain [1]. While back pain in pregnancy is quite a commonplace occurrence, the degrees at which it affects those pregnant differs from woman to woman. Even if the same woman becomes pregnant multiple times, the intensity of back pain, if experienced, might not be the same in all the pregnancies. According to the National Centre for Biotechnology Information, pregnancy-related back pain is one of the common complaints among pregnant women [2]. Lower back pain can have an adverse or negative impact upon the life of the woman suffering from it [3]. As per NCBI, lower back pain in a pregnant woman can manifest itself either as the following: •Pain in the pelvic region also referred to as “pelvic girdle pain” [PGP], and • A pain over and around the lumbar spine also called “lumbar pain” [LP]. The best course of action in cases of back pain in pregnant women is of trying to diagnose the pain as early as possible to minimize the impact on the woman’s quality of life. Let us see as to what are the common causes of back pain in pregnant women. Physical Causes 1.Weight gain The weight gained during pregnancy exerts added pressure on the joints and muscles of the body. The additional weight also causes strain on the pelvic region as well as the lumbar area. 2. Increase in stomach size The change in the size of the abdomen or stomach also weighs down on the pelvis leading to pain in the back of pregnant women. 3. Change in the gravity centre of the body The body gravity centre changes during pregnancy, adding to the stress put on the lower back. The posture of the body adopted by the pregnant woman also has a role to play. Various studies have led to the finding that lower back pain [LBP] during pregnancy might be strongly related in general to the movements of the body, and in particular to the posture of the body [4]. 4. Physiological changes A major physiological change during pregnancy that is closely associated with pregnancy is that of the hormonal changes in the body. During pregnancy, the body goes through a lot of hormonal changes, which have been found to lead to pain and inflammation in the back [5]. Increased levels of the hormone relaxin – secreted by the placenta for causing the cervix to dilate and prepare the uterus for labour – has a direct correlation with back pain during pregnancy. It is estimated that the levels of relaxin in the body increase 10 times more than the usual during pregnancy [6]. Remedies For Back Pain During Pregnancy In a survey of 275 women before Week 12 of pregnancy, it was found that daily routine activity of pregnant women is linked to low back pain [7]. The findings of the survey suggest that low back pain in pregnant women can be managed by making changes to the basic physical movements. For example, even the simple act of changing the way of standing up can be changed to that it can reduce the weight on the body.Taking adequate rest is also highly recommended. Pregnancy is a time to take it easy, so to speak. A rule of thumb to follow when you are pregnant is that of following every instruction of your doctor. Regardless of how much advice you get, solicited or unsolicited, always keep in mind that your doctor always knows the best. Always. Never try anything just because it worked out for your friend or neighbour. No two pregnancies are the same. What worked for someone you know might not bring you the same results. Moreover, you might not even know the whole story behind your advisor’s experience. While it might not be possible to completely cure cases of lower back pain in pregnant women, it can be adequately reduced to a certain extent. Early identification and treatment are essential. Differentiating between pelvic girdle pain and lumbar pain is important as the treatment differs accordingly [8].',\n",

       " 'CHANDIGARH: Only about 3 per cent of registered workers are getting jobs for 100 days in Punjab under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). While 14 lakh workers are getting work, only 10,000 of them are fortunate enough to get work for more than 100 days in a financial year.  This hurts rural households as daily wages is on the lower side — workers get `241 per day in Punjab, whereas Haryana pays ` 284 per day. Incidentally, NITI Aayog’s SDG Index 2019-20 report revealed employment under MGNREGA come down from 81.63 per cent to 76.12 per cent in Punjab. In its Lok Sabha poll manifesto, the Congress had promised to ensure 150 days to rural workforce under this scheme. But if the numbers are considered, only a miniscule portion of daily wage earners are meeting the threshold of 100-day employment. But Rural Development and Panchayats, principal secretary, Seema Jain says the state has seen in a consistent improvement in MGNREGA performance in last three years. “The overall expenditure was well above in terms of total man days generated.  As of now 205 lakh man days have been generated in the present financial year and `656 crore spent. There is still six weeks for the financial year to close. We have already exceeded our target. This scheme has empowered women and generated employment,’’ Jain said. One of the reasons blamed for this poor performance is the lack of awareness and illiteracy among workers. The SOP is that workers register for work following which they are informed about the details of assigned work through a work allotment letter. But, it was found that this procedure is largely sidestepped as workers are not aware of their rights because of illiteracy It not only leads to irregularities but also causes delay in the release of payment. Sources said that there was a delay in payments of MGNREGS wages for a few months last year. In November last year, the Punjab government dismissed five employees of the rural development department for their involvement in a `2.59 crore scam in the scheme. These employees allegedly submitted fake payment receipts and indulged in other irregularities.',\n",

Having known the importance of digital technology in expanding businesses, travel companies are now using artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots and other applications to transform customers’ experience to attract more travellers and retain their clients, according to travel aggregator Shoes on Loose. This Delhi-based travel start-up was launched in 2011 by three IIT-Delhi alumni and is tapping technology to create a transparent picture between travellers and service providers, said its CEO and founder, Mohit Poddar. Shoes on Loose, currently has 50 travel experts on board, and all are trained in delivering end-to-end solutions in destination travel. “Travellers come to us and avoid companies that follow old-school models. We use chatbots to interact with them in real time — answering all their queries. This results in a two-way communication,” explained Poddar. A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users over internet. The algorithm is based on a flow chart with probable questions and answers, he said, adding, “once they register themselves, they go through the flow to get answers, choose a place, and pay for it. The process becomes seamless with the help of AI.” Here, AI plays an important role to help convert 15 to 20 per cent users in its consumer base. This bootstrap start-up is also working to develop a client dashboard that will help travellers access trip details, vouchers, itinerary, blogs, thereby getting a complete knowledge of the destination they are heading for. Moreover, if someone visits the website, the system also analyses the number of visits, the kind of blogs being read, and the packages being enquired about. “We get all kinds of insights to help them in a better way,” said Poddar. The travel aggregator has developed the concept of ‘destination experts’, where each of its team members is working on only one destination at a time, he said, adding, “They channelise their effort and time to curate value for money itinerary for clients to deliver the best experience. We also have our in-house CRMs in place.” The start-up is coming up with an app so that it can help people raise issues and communicate directly with channel partners and service providers.',\n",

       " 'Lucknow: Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas chief Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and VHP vice president Champat Rai were anointed as Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Khestra Trust’s president and general secretary on Wednesday. With the move, the saints and seers of Ayodhya finally have heaved a sigh of relief. A euphoria could be felt in the temple town on Wednesday evening after the announcement at the first meeting of the trust in New Delhi. There has been discontent among the seers over Das not being included in the board of trustees. The VHP leadership were also taken by surprise over its non-representation in the trust announced by the government on February 5. Initially, the 15-member trust did not have a single saint from Ayodhya. Only Raja Bimalendra Mohan Pratap Mishra of Ayodhya royal family and Dr Anil Mishra, who is believed to be associated with the RSS, were nominated to it. However, the importance of the presence of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and Champat Rai in the trust to facilitate temple construction could not be overlooked by the Centre as the Union Home Minister had to intervene and pacify the enraged seers. The presence of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das in Trust was important as he is a prominent and revered figure in Ayodhya. The pithadhishwar of Ayodhya’s largest temple, Mani Ram Das Ki Chavani, and the chief of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, Mahant has played a very crucial role in spearheading the temple movement and taking it this long. “Mahant Nritya Gopal Das is an ideal for all of us. The Ram temple (in Ayodhya) will be constructed under his leadership. The campaign (for constructing Ram temple) has reached this point under his leadership,” says Mahant Satyendra Das, head priest of the makeshift temple. Both Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and Champat Rai have been very well-versed with the demography of the area and have kept the temple work on by running the workshop, ensuring transpiration of stone slabs, carving and engraving after the demolition of the disputed structure. In fact, Nritya Gopal Das is credited with building many temples — Ramayan Bhavan, the Shri Rangnath temple and the Shri Char Dham temple– in Ayodhya. In 2001, unidentified assailants hurled country-made bombs at him and his disciples, as they were returning from the Sarayu river after their morning bath. He survived with minor injuries. Since then, he is guarded by two policemen. In 2003, he took over the Nyas after Ramchandra Paramhans’s death. Similarly, the representation of  VHP, which played a critical role in the Ram Mandir movement in the 1980s and 1990s is also deemed to be very important. It was VHP under Ashok Singhal that took the Ram Janmabhoomi issue out of Ayodhya and created a pan-India movement. The organisation also played a key role in proposing and popularising the model for the Ram Temple. The Centre’s decision not to nominate Nritya Gopal Das as a member of Board of Trustees of the new Trust was not without reason. In the wake of criminal proceedings underway against Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and Champat Rai at the special CBI court in Lucknow in connection with the demolition of Babri Masjid, had the Centre appointed them as members of Board of Trustees of the new Trust, there was the possibility of anyone challenging the Trust in the Supreme Court. The only way out was that the Board of Trustees used the power to nominate two more members of the Trust.

Singh said people can become AAP members by either reaching out to party offices and getting receipts or by giving missed calls. They can even enrol through the party’s website. AAP, however, has not yet decided if it will contest the 2022 Assembly polls in the state. “It is for the party to decide on this issue. There is still some time for the next Assembly polls here,” he added. The AAP has also decided to launch a major publicity blitzkrieg in Uttar Pradesh. More than 5,000 posters and banners will be put up in each district, highlighting the AAP’s model of politics and development. The party has 60 active district-level units in UP and aims at increasing its presence in other  Assembly constituencies.',\n",
       " 'DEHRADUN: Upbeat after sweeping the Assembly elections and keen to extend its footprints beyond the territorial limits of the national capital, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has set sights on electoral gains in faraway Uttarakhand. The Himalayan state is scheduled to go to polls in March 2022.  The buzz around its national ambitions started gaining ground after the Arvind Kejriwal-led party roared back to the hustings on the back of a resounding mandate. While the final tally put the AAP at a commanding 62 seats, the BJP, which was bidding to unseat the former from power, had to settle for just 8 seats.  The Congress failed to open its account, in a repeat of its dismal 2015 show. The AAP’s Uttarakhand unit on Wednesday declared that the party would field candidates from all 70 Assembly constituencies in the state. Rakesh Sinha, president of the AAP’s Uttarakhand unit, said, “Rampant corruption in every level of governance and administration has plagued the hill state since it was founded on November 9, 2000. It’s been two decades since Uttarakhand became a separate state and we still haven’t been able to provide basic amenities to the people. There are the ones the statehood was for. We will fight the elections on the promise of rooting out corruption.”',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Ahead of US President Donald Trump’s maiden India visit next week, an influential US Congressman on Wednesday expressed concern over the situation in Kashmir and agitations over the new citizenship law, saying the country must protect its minorities and not lose its secular democracy. Ami Bera, Chair of House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific in the US Congress, said it was the desire of the US to see resolution of the Kashmir issue and return of normalcy in the region. Bera, a Democrat, and George Holding, the Republican co-chair of the India caucus, are on a two-day visit to India to “demonstrate” bipartisan support to India in the US Congress. “We expressed our concerns over the continued detention of political leaders in Kashmir,” Bera told a group of journalists when asked whether he and Holding conveyed their concerns to Indian officials over the situation in Kashmir. “We do not want to India to lose secular democracy that is what sets it apart from countries in the region, that is what makes it such a valuable partner of the US,” he said. Bera also said he would like to take a Congressional delegation to Kashmir. “We did express our that we would like to take a delegation to Kashmir in some point of time.” The US lawmaker also hailed India’s vibrant democracy where he said 800 million Hindus are living side-by-side with 200 million Muslims. “Indian citizens are the ones that ultimately will control the outcome of where India heads to. We can offer what we admire about India. Is that it’s this vibrant secular democracy and we would hate to see India lose or tarnish any of that reputation,” said Bera. On his part, Holding said economic development will bring prosperity to Kashmir, adding a stable and predictable political situation is going to attract investment into the region. The special status of Jammu and Kashmir was withdrawn around six months back and it was bifurcated into two union territories. The government had imposed severe restrictions following the move including detaining a sizeable number of political leaders. Replying to a question on widespread protests against the new citizenship law in India, Bera said expressed concerns over it but at the same time added that the demonstrations reflected inherent strength of the democracy. “It is important to keep lines of communications open,” he said, adding India must protect its minorities. India has witnessed massive protests against the citizenship amendment law which seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslims who came to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh facing religious persecution. The protesters feel the law is discriminatory as citizenship will be granted based on religious identity. Both the lawmakers also spoke about the bipartisan support to growing ties between India and the US in diverse areas including in trade and commerce, defence and strategic affairs. Both the lawmakers hoped that India and the US will be able to seal the much-anticipated trade deal. Official sources said negotiations on the deal was not “stuck” and both sides mutually agreed “not to rush” into it, suggesting that it will not be signed during Trump’s visit to India next week. Trump, accompanied by wife Melania Trump and a high-level delegation will arrive in India on February 24 for a little less than 36-hour-long trip. From Ahmedabad, he will travel to Agra before arriving at the national capital for the main leg of the visit.',\n",

Over the last few weeks, the features and specifications of the smartphone have been leaked online, giving a clear idea of what the device offers. Now, just a week away from the official launch, Ishan Agarwal has confirmed that the Samsung Galaxy M31 will be available in three color variants. The device will be available in red, blue, and black colors. It is also interesting to note that the Samsung Galaxy M31 has a plastic unibody design, just like its predecessor — the Galaxy M30s and the Galaxy M30.

       " 'Nosebleeds are a common problem that mostly occurs in adults and children aged between 3 and 10. Nosebleeds occur rarely and don’t always indicate signs of serious health problems. The nose contains many small blood vessels, which are situated close to the surface in the nose and are fragile and have the tendency to bleed easily. Drying of the nasal membranes and nose picking are the most common causes of nosebleeds. Nosebleeds are of two types – anterior nosebleed and posterior nosebleed. Anterior nosebleed occurs in the front of the nose and posterior nosebleed occurs in the back of the nose. How To Stop A Nosebleed Relax yourself Try to stay calm and relaxed because if you are nervous, it can actually make you bleed more. Sit up and lean forward Sit up and lean forward to prevent the bleeding from trickling down the back of your throat as this could lead to vomiting and it may irritate your stomach. By sitting up, the blood pressure in the veins of the nose reduces. Pinch your nose Use your thumb and index finger to press your nostrils and breathe through your mouth. Keep pressing it for 10 to 15 minutes as this will help put pressure on the part of the nose that’s bleeding and will stop the blood flow. If the bleeding continues even after 10-15 minutes, repeat the process for 10-15 minutes more. And avoid using any cotton pads, tampons, and tissues to stop the bleeding. Use a decongestant nasal spray Use a decongestant nasal spray such as oxymetazoline in both the nostrils. Press both your nostrils and breathe through your mouth for 5 to 10 minutes. ow To Prevent Nosebleeds Keep your nose moist Dryness causes your nose to bleed, so keep the inside of your nose moist by applying petroleum jelly with the help of a cotton pad. You can also keep your nostrils moist with the help of a saline spray. Clip your fingernails Keep your fingernails short. If you have long and sharp fingernails you may prick your nose accidentally and it may start bleeding. Use a humidifier Humidifier adds moisture to the mucous membranes and prevents it from drying out, thus preventing a nosebleed. Protect your nose Consider wearing a protective nose mask while playing any kind of sports that may hurt your nose and cause a nosebleed.',\n",

       " 'CHENNAI:  The International Cricket Council’s (ICC) decision to have a global event every year in the calendar between 2023-31 is paving the way for a confrontation. The BCCI, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and possibly Cricket Australia (CA) will oppose the move, with the other seven full members in favour of it. The matter will be up for discussion in ICC’s quarterly meeting in March. As things stand, the BCCI is not happy with the manner the international body has gone about preparing the calendar and believes it will have its way. The ICC in an email to its members, including the associates, has asked them to express interest should they wish to host any of the 20 global events from 2023-31. Apart from World T20 and 50-over World Cups, the ICC has reportedly included two new events called the T20 Champions Cup and ODI Champions Cup, which will be held every four years involving the top 10 and top six teams, respectively. As reported by this newspaper, the Big 3 (BCCI, ECB, CA) have been opposing the move to have new global events other than the existing ones. They believe it will result in revenue loss, as they will be playing fewer bilateral series. Though the BCCI has not made an attempt to expedite the process of expressing dissatisfaction because it believes there is time, the ICC’s decision to speed things up has more to do with the future of other member nations. While the bilateral series continue to be profitable for the Big Three, the same cannot be said of other boards, especially with so many T20 leagues mushrooming across the globe. Unless India and one of Australia and England play them at least once annually, they find it difficult to generate revenue from bilateral series. Instead, if they commit to a global event and sign the Members Playing Agreement, they are guaranteed around $120-125 million in the cycle. “The ICC wants to push it so that it can help these boards. At the moment, the BCCI and ICC are far from reaching an agreement. But whatever happens, an extra global event is not acceptable to the BCCI. Moreover, by having an event every year, the ICC is trying to dilute the World Cup and T20 World Cup,” a BCCI official told this newspaper.The BCCI, which expects ECB and CA to oppose this proposal in March, is aware of the monetary considerations of the other boards. That ICC CEO Manu Sawhney,  who is at the forefront of this plan hasn’t met them even once, but has met every other board hasn’t gone unnoticed by the BCCI. But they believe an alternative formula can be devised. Making things complicated is the fact that the boards of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Africa have their broadcast rights up for renewal this year. With the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) not having any bilateral series with India, they expect their value to go down considerably and considering the dwindling fortunes of their teams, Cricket South Africa and Sri Lanka Cricket too expect rate cuts. Incidentally, rights of all these boards are owned by the same broadcaster and they are finding it difficult to sell the rights this time.“There are only two-three big players when it comes to broadcast deals. To sell it to them, these boards need an affirmative plan. So unless the Big 3 guarantee a bilateral series with them every year, others will take up the ICC offer.

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO: A multi-billion dollar dispute between Facebook and US tax authorities over profits shifted to an Irish subsidiary began playing out in front of a judge on Tuesday. The Internal Revenue Service contends that Facebook dodged about $9 billion in taxes, while the leading social network says it is actually owed a refund, according to US media reports. “This trial is about transactions that took place in 2010, when Facebook had no mobile advertising revenue, its international business was nascent, and its digital advertising products were unproven,” spokesperson Bertie Thomson said in an email response to an AFP inquiry. “We look forward to presenting our case in court and putting an end to this years-long dispute.” The judge is to hear from an array of Facebook executives during the course of proceedings. Shifting profits to low-tax countries is a routine practice by international companies, and the judge’s decision in this case is seen as a possible harbinger about whether that tactic will become less effective. The tax period involved dates back nearly a decade to before Facebook became a publicly-traded company and smartphones became primary devices for engaging with social media. The IRS contends that Facebook undervalued technology it licensed to its Irish subsidiary, thereby cutting the amount of money that came to the US for taxation here. Facebook has countered that it should have valued the technology even lower, further reducing the amount paid by the subsidiary and, therefore, the amount subject to taxation in the US. “Throughout Facebook’s history, we have worked with the IRS and complied with all applicable tax laws,” Thomson said. “Our business has had hits and misses but we stand behind the actions taken over a decade ago during a time of great risk and uncertainty for the company.”',\n",

Located at NSC Bose Road, TTK Road and KK Nagar, the civic body is planning to allocate one of the homes for men, another for people with mental illness and the third for elderly. This is a part of the corporation’s project to build 33 new shelters across the city at a cost of `1.38 crore. “We rescue anywhere between 60 and 70 people, fortnightly. People with mental illness and elderly constitute most of them, so these shelters will help accommodate them. They will look like the existing shelters in the city, equipped with facilities like kitchen and restrooms,” said a corporation official and further added, “The new shelter at NSC Bose Road will be allocated for men. NGOs have been shortlisted for all the three shelters.” Apart from these, eight other shelters are nearing completion, including the ones at Gurupuram, Desam Salai and Driver Street. At least one of these too, will be allocated for people with mental illness. Having procured three vehicles to carry out the rescue operations daily, civic body officials say more shelters will be helpful to rescue more people, since a few shelter homes in the city are already overcrowded. A recent study by the civic body found that more than 10,000 people, including children, are homeless in the city. In the recent years, nearly 2,000 people have been rescued and given shelter. The norm is to have 70 shelter homes for a population of 8.5 million in Chennai. Since the city is already equipped with 38 shelters, the civic body is planning to finish the construction of rest of the shelters by May 2020. Apart from this, the officials are calling for corporate social responsibility funds from private companies to upgrade the existing shelter homes.”We are currently getting a fund of `10,00,000 per shelter home for a year of operation and maintenance. However, we are only able to provide basic facilities like food, blankets, mats, pillows and medicines through the fund. So, if the CSR fund flows in, we can upgrade the shelter homes with television, cots and CCTVs,” the official said.  Currently, there are 38 shelters for homeless persons in the city, which are run by NGOs under the purview of the civic body.',\n",
       " 'MADRID: Liverpool were the victims of an old-fashioned Atletico Madrid masterclass on Tuesday as Diego Simeone’s side ground out a 1-0 win in Madrid to give themselves hope of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. Saul Niguez raised the roof at a bouncing Wanda Metropolitano by scoring in the fourth minute before Atletico’s defence kicked in, suffocating the European champions and denying them a single shot on target. “Tonight is one of those nights you don’t forget,” said Simeone. “We haven’t gone through but we have beaten the best team in the world.” If Alvaro Morata had not slipped at the crucial moment, Atleti might even have taken a two-goal lead to Anfield, where they can expect an onslaught next month. “We are not 5-0 down,” said Jurgen Klopp. “We don’t think it will be easy but as long as we can get 11 players in Liverpool shirts we will give everything we have. And for all the Liverpool fans that can get a ticket — welcome to Anfield.” If Liverpool remain favourites to go through, the roar from the Atleti fans at the final whistle, aimed at their fist-pumping players on the pitch, suggested Simeone’s team now have belief. Few had tipped them to keep this tie even alive for the second leg given their own stuttering form, in contrast to Liverpool, unbeaten in the Premier League, and gunning for a treble. Jurgen Klopp said on Monday Atletico were a “results machine” but the temptation was to see his words as platitudes, not an accurate reflection of a side that sits 13 points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid and had already lost six times this season. Yet Atletico under Simeone have also become synonymous with upsetting the odds, just as they did when winning the Spanish title in 2014 and then twice reaching the Champions League final. For all their failings this season, they summoned that spirit here to produce a throwback performance full of tenacity, resilience and guts that was always going to be needed to give them any chance of success. Before the match, Atletico’s team bus had arrived at the stadium under plumes of red smoke. “We started to win the game when the bus came around the roundabout and we saw our fans,” said Simeone. He sprung a surprise by starting Thomas Lemar for the first time this year while Alvaro Morata and Diego Costa both returned from injury, the former from the start and the latter off the bench in the second half.',\n",
       " 'COVENTRY: Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover on Tuesday warned that its production schedules in the UK, as well as India, are under strain due to its supply chains in coronavirus-hit China. JLR CEO Ralf Speth said the company has enough supplies to ensure production for the next two weeks, but from the third week onwards it remains risky and could even mean plant closures. “We have flown parts in suitcases just to make sure we have all the parts but for the third week, we still have parts missing,” said Speth. Tata Motors CEO and Managing Director Guenter Butschek, in the UK for the official launch of the company’s new National Automotive Innovation Centre (NAIC) at the University of Warwick in Coventry, said the same scenario was playing out in the Tata Group firm’s Indian base and that they have been “tracking and tracing” the situation on a very microscopic level to modify production strategy as things develop. “Everything mentioned by Ralf is not just an issue for Jaguar Land Rover. Although we have all of our operations domestically located in India, we are pretty much in the same boat,” said Butschek. “In particular, the automotive industry is largely dependent on its global supply network. We are all in some way dependent on our suppliers out of China. We are following the situation on a daily basis to see how it is developing,” he said. Referring to the timing of the crisis as the company works towards implementing the Indian government’s Bharat Stage (BS) VI regulations for cleaner vehicle emissions, the senior Tata Group executive admitted that the supply crisis has come at a “critical” period for the company. “As it looks, we are safe for the month of February and for a good part of March. We are at a critical transition stage to BS-VI and at the same time we are doing mid-cycle enhancements of products, this puts us in a very critical light because we are in the ramp-up stage of all our products,” he said. Tata Motors said the complexity of its supply chains means that even though parts may be available, the big challenge is getting them out of the region of Wuhan \\x96 the epicenter of the virus, which remains inaccessible. As China combats COVID-19 or the coronavirus strain, factory shutdowns and movement restrictions in the country’s auto manufacturing hubs are having widespread knock-on effects on the industry. JLR said that as a result of no operational dealerships in the region, its sales in China have also taken a major hit in recent weeks. Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land also unveiled a new futuristic electric driverless car concept as part of a spin-off project developed at its new innovation centre at the University of Warwick in central England.

       " 'KABUL: The US and the Taliban, at war since 2001, are on the verge of agreeing a landmark withdrawal deal to be signed in Qatar, an insurgent source told AFP on Tuesday. An Afghan official suggested the deal could be inked on February 29 in Doha, depending on the success of a violence reduction period agreed last week after long negotiations between Washington and the jihadists. The US wants to reduce its military presence in Afghanistan, which currently numbers between 12,000 and 13,000, with President Donald Trump keen to make good on a promise to bring troops home after 18 years of war. “All the arrangements have been finalized and the leadership council has given a go-ahead signal to the Taliban negotiating team,” a Taliban source in Pakistan said. There have been previous false dawns in Afghanistan, with a deal all but complete in September before Trump nixed it at the last moment amid continued Taliban violence. The Taliban source said the jihadists would meet the US negotiators in Doha on Sunday to agree on a date and location for the signing ceremony. Both sides were close to agreeing to hold the ceremony during the last week of February, he added. “Even last time, we were committed to sign the deal, but it was US President Trump’s decision to backtrack from what both the teams had agreed in Doha,” the Taliban source said. “(The signing) is going to happen this time.” The Afghan official suggested the ceremony would “take place in Doha if the violence reduction period goes smoothly”. Masoud Andarabi, Afghanistan’s acting interior minister, said at a workshop in Kabul on Tuesday that the violence reduction period “begins in the next five days”. The Kabul government did not comment on his announcement. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has said the Taliban’s sincerity in entering the violence reduction agreement was unproven. “That’s the billion dollar question,” Ghani said at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. But, he added, “you’re not going to find an answer to this question unless you engage in the peace process.” Ghani was named on Tuesday the winner of Afghanistan’s presidential polls held in September 2019. His rival Abdullah Abdullah contested the final results, vowing he would form his own parallel government.',\n",

A Sikh boy presented him a bouquet. Guterres was also briefed about the Kartarpur Corridor pact between Pakistan and India. He was told that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan took this initiative to facilitate the Sikh community of India and elsewhere to visit the shrine. The corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur – the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev – to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India’s Gurdaspur district. Wearing an orange scarf, Guterres visited different parts of the Gurdwara. He was served with traditional food in lunch along with Sikhs and Pakistani officials. Strict security measures were taken during the visit. Indian Sikhs in good number were also present at Kartarpur Sahib. Talking to media persons, the UN Secretary-General said the Kartarpur Corridor is a practical example of Pakistan’s desire for peace and inter-faith harmony, Radio Pakistan reported. He said the opening of the corridor is a good step and it will promote tolerance and interfaith harmony. The UN chief appreciated the facilities being provided to Sikh pilgrims at the complex. Talking to the state television after his visit, Guterres said: “This is a very emotional moment. And I cannot be here without having a very strong feeling. It is wonderful to see the interfaith dialogue. It is wonderful to see in the same shrine today Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, maybe Hindus — all worshipping in harmony and in peace”. He further said this is the best symbol that “we can give for a world in peace and for a world in which there is a mutual respect and there is the acceptance of what is different recognising that diversity is a blessing, is a richness, not a threat.” “When we see so many parts of the world fighting in the name of religion, it’s necessary to say that religions unite us for peace and the best symbol is this shrine”. Later in the day, he visited Badshahi Masjid and had dinner at Hazuri Bagh area outside the Lahore Fort. “I’ve been to Amritsar, today I’m here, to pay tribute to the contribution of the Sikh community all over the world for our planet.

The notices were issued after reports from the police, UIDAI said. “Aadhaar is not a document of citizenship and UIDAI has been mandated under the Aadhaar Act to ascertain residency of a person in India for 182 days prior to applying for Aadhaar,” the nodal body, which issues the 12-digit biometric ID, said in a statement. The Supreme Court, in its landmark decision, has directed the UIDAI not to issue Aadhaar to illegal immigrants, it said. Recipients are now planning to approach the High Court in order to challenge the notices. One of the notices sent to a Mohammed Sattar, a resident of Talab Katta in the Old City area, stated that the recipient allegedly ‘obtained Aadhar through false pretences’ and that he was not an ‘Indian national’. It said, “Whereas this Office has received a complaint/allegation that you are not an Indian National and you have obtained Aadhaar through false pretences, making false claims and submitting false documents. An enquiry has been ordered by the Regional office, UIDAI, Hyderabad, to ascertain the veracity of the complaint/allegation.” UIDAI further directed Sattar to appear before an officer in Balapur “to prove all your claims of citizenship and if you are not a stay is valid Indian National, to prove that you have entered the territory of Indian legal and your stay is valid.” UIDAI warned that if Sattar does not appear and produce the required documents “the matter shall be decided suo motu”. The document was signed by Amita Bindroo, deputy director of UIDAI Hyderabad. “It may be noted that the regional office Hyderabad received reports from the state police that 127 people have obtained Aadhaar on false pretences, as in their preliminary enquiry they were found illegal immigrants who were not qualified to obtain an Aadhaar number,” the UIDAI said. As per the Aadhaar Act, such Aadhaar numbers are liable to be cancelled. “Therefore, the regional office Hyderabad has sent notices to them to appear in person and to substantiate their claims for getting an Aadhaar number,” it said. The UIDAI, however, emphasised that these notices have “nothing to do with citizenship and cancellation of Aadhaar number is in no way related to the nationality of any resident”. In case it is found and proved that any of them obtained Aadhaar by submitting false documents or through false pretences, their Aadhaar is liable to be cancelled or suspended depending on the severity of the transgression, UIDAI said.',\n",

While Samsung, Huawei, and Motorola have already launched a foldable smartphone, Apple, TCL, and a couple of other companies have patented foldable designs. But now, TCL has patented a new sliding design for a smartphone. CNET reports a new slide-out design is unlike anything we’ve seen so far. The novel design is capable of sliding out without an actual hinge. The purpose is to give the users much more screen space, as much as a tablet. The point is, users won’t be carrying a tablet but will have a display like one. The leaked images reveal a usual smartphone, which then turns into a tablet once the screen is pulled out. Although there are no precise details and TCL has refrained from commenting, the concept phone may use one continuous display, with curved screens on either side. The image also reveals that there’s a slight break in chassis (between the center of the phone and the dual selfie camera on the right side). This break is what creates the slide, where the user can pull the screen for a tablet effect. The report speculates that the sliding smartphone has one portion of the flexible display overlapping or bending over the other. This design would make the phone thicker, but users would still get a tablet display. The rear part of the TCL concept phone reveals the extend portion with its non-glass back to support the display. The Samsung Galaxy Fold, Moto Razr, and other foldable phones in the market have a lot of issues with the folding mechanism, especially with the hinge and the display. The new TCL sliding phone is intriguing because it’s giving users a tablet view with a device sized like a smartphone. Plus, there’s no complication of the bending mechanism. It could surpass problems like the crease with the foldable design, and much more. If the MWC event had gone according to plan, TCL would have revealed the new sliding phone. However, the event was canceled due to fears over coronavirus. However, even before the organizers had announced the cancellation, TCL had withdrawn from the event citing similar fears.',\n",

Paul, who had gone to Mumbai to visit his daughter, complained of chest pain at the Mumbai airport during his return to Kolkata and was rushed to a hospital in Juhu but died around 4 am, the source said. He had been suffering from heart ailments and been to hospitals several times for treatment during the past two years. Paul, a two-term MP from Krishnanagar and an MLA from Alipore, is survived by his daughter and wife. He was born in Chandannagar in Hooghly district and graduated from Hooghly Mohsin College in bioscience. Paul moved away from films and active politics after the CBI arrested him in the Rose Valley chit-fund scam in December 2016 and was given bail after 13 months. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in her condolence message, said Paul’s death has left a deep void in films and politics. “Saddened and shocked to hear about the demise of Tapas Paul. He was a superstar of Bengali cinema who was a member of the Trinamool family. Tapas served the people as a two-term MP and MLA. We will miss him dearly. My condolences to his wife Nandini, daughter Sohini and his many fans,” Banerjee tweeted. A romantic hero, having endeared himself to the Bengali audience since his debut film “Dadar Kirti” in 1980, Paul became a household name courtesy his lead roles in “Saheb” (1981), “Parabat Priya” (1984), “Bhalobasa Bhalobasa” (1985), “Anurager Choyan” (1986) and “Amar Bandhan” (1986). He made his Bollywood debut in Hiren Nag’s “Abodh” (1984) opposite Madhuri Dixit Nene. He was awarded the Filmfare Award for “Saheb” (1981). In a career spanning over three decades, Paul had worked with veteran actors Prosenjit Chatterjee, Soumitra Chatterjee, Ranjit Mallick and Raakhee Gulzar. Some of his last appearances were in films such as “Khiladi” and “Aat ta Aater Bongaon Local”. Actor Ranjit Mallick described Paul’s death as “untimely”. “I am yet to come to terms with the news. He was like my younger brother. He was not keeping well for some time,” Mallick said. After the TMC was formed in 1998, Paul, inspired by Banerjee and her fight against the Left Front regime, had joined the political party in 2000. He was elected as the MLA from Alipore Assembly seat in 2001. During the 2008-09 period, when West Bengal was witnessing winds of change, Paul had played an instrumental role in helping the party penetrate the Bengali film industry, which till then was under the firm control of the Left Front-aligned actors and directors. After Paul’s arrest in the Rose Valley chit-fund scam, his family members had time and again alleged that the party did not bother to enquire about him.

       " 'WASHINGTON: His company is often criticized for its environmental record, but Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and the world’s richest man, said he was committing USD 10 billion to a new fund to tackle climate change. In a post to his 1.4 million followers on Instagram on Monday, the e-commerce tycoon said the Bezos Earth Fund would “fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.” “Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,” said Bezos, whose net worth is estimated to be around USD 130 billion. Hundreds of Amazon employees last month signed a blog criticizing the online retail giant’s climate policies and demanding it do more to tackle climate change. Amazon has been accused of creating vast amounts of waste from the packaging it uses for doorstep deliveries, as well as for the greenhouse gas emissions from huge fleets of vehicles. The company, which in December said its workforce had hit 750,000, has also been denounced over its carbon footprint because of the high energy consumption of its server farms for its lucrative cloud computing activities. “I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share,” Bezos said in his announcement on Monday. Bezos, who maintained his status as the world’s richest person despite an expensive divorce last year, said his new foundation would begin issuing grants later this year. Last September, he said Amazon would pledge to become carbon neutral by 2040 and vowed that the company would order 100,000 electric delivery trucks. Rather than make investments that the business guru might profit from, the fund would allocate grant money to projects, The New York Times said, quoting unnamed sources familiar with the initiative. Bezos divulged few details on his social media post, which attracted overwhelmingly positive responses from his followers. Bezos has often clashed with US President Donald Trump, who regularly attacks climate change activists, recently calling them “perennial prophets of doom.” The fund was described as Bezos’s biggest philanthropic commitment. Fellow billionaire Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, now devotes much of his time to his charity foundation and a venture fund that makes investments aimed at helping curb emissions and reverse climate change.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Asserting that there will be no “honeymoon period” for the new AAP government, the party on Monday said a significant reduction in pollution, cleaning of the Yamuna and ensuring deployment of ‘mohalla marshalls’ to boost women’s security would be among the top priorities of the new Arvind Kejriwal-led dispensation. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj also claimed that his party won because it was able to “puncture the narrative” of the BJP that “AAP is anti-Hindu”. “The Kejriwal 3. 0 is at work from day one. There is no honeymoon period for the AAP government. We have spelt out the roadmap for the next five years,” Bhardwaj told PTI. Buoyant after being re-elected as the Greater Kailash MLA in the February 8 polls, he said the new government’s aim would also be to meet the target of building a total of 1,000 mohalla clinics in this term. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues took charge of their respective offices on Monday and asserted that they would work to fulfil the promises made in the “guarantee card” released during the poll campaign, including a reduction in pollution and expansion of the metro network. “One of the top priorities would be to tackle pollution in the national capital. We want to reduce pollution by 300 per cent in the next five years. Cleaning Yamuna river by creating a network of sewage treatment plants and interceptors and by reviving water bodies across Delhi would be also our top agenda,” he said. Bhardwaj asserted that the safety and security of women shall be augmented by the deployment of ‘mohalla marshalls’. “Making Delhi safer and more secure for women is one of our top priorities and this will be done by extending the concept of bus marshalls to mohalla marshals. It was in our poll manifesto and this step will be implemented,” the AAP MLA said. The ‘mohalla marshall’ would be a security layer between police and citizens to help women and senior citizens feel safer, the senior leader said, adding that they would work in shifts “whole day and whole night”. Asked what favoured the AAP’s return to power, he said in this election a large section of voters were those who were not benefiting from the subsidy, free electricity and water. “The biggest example is the Greater Kailash constituency, where the youth of CR Park, GK-I and Alaknanda areas voted for AAP for the first time. Traditionally, this voter segment has been voting for the BJP for the last five years,” he claimed. It is not subsidy they voted for, but for governance, Bhardwaj said. The AAP MLA alleged that during the campaign, the BJP attempted to “create a narrative that anybody other than BJP is anti-Hindu”. “Our party countered that polarisation. It was difficult for them (BJP) to prove that Saurabh Bhardwaj, Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia are anti-Hindu because we are Hindu,” he said. “Probably, we were able to puncture the narrative that AAP is anti-Hindu. We were able to convince the people that one can be a good Hindu as well as not hate any other religion,” the AAP leader said. He said the BJP had huge resources, MPs, home minister and chief ministers who came during campaigning and “attempted to polarise voters”. “But we were able to counter and contain it. Had polarisation worked we would have lost it,” he said. Asked if the AAP at any point of time panicked, he said, “We could realise BJP trying very hard to polarise voters. But no, we didn’t”. “We always expected 60 plus seats,” he said when asked what was the party’s expectations from the polls. Arvind Kejriwal led the AAP to a scintillating win in the assembly polls bagging 62 of the 70 seats, leaving BJP with just eights seats while Congress again drew a blank.',\n",

Ritu Khosla from the Shaheen Bagh Co-ordination Committee told PTI, “The SC’s decision is welcome and we fully accept it. We will be happy to meet the mediators who have been appointed by the apex court. I don’t know if the protesters would agree to move. The decision to change the venue of the protest will entirely depend on the joint decision taken by all protesters of Shaheen Bagh.” The famous grandmothers or ‘dadis’ of Shaheen Bagh welcomed the decision saying they now expect genuine mediation with the government. “We have wanted to talk to the government for two months. We tried various times to have a dialogue and marched towards the home minister’s house too. However, the police always stopped us. We are ready to talk but there should be a genuine interaction and mediation between us and the government,” Sharvari Dadi of Shaheen Bagh said. The Shaheen Bagh protestors had marched towards Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s residence on February 16 seeking to talk to him about the new citizenship law. They were stopped by Delhi Police midway.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Negotiations are going on between India and the US to iron out differences for a proposed trade package but chances of signing a deal during US President Donald Trump’s visit here next week are thin, sources said on Monday. Officials of both the countries are yet to resolve issues pertaining to sectors, including politically sensitive agriculture and dairy, even as less than a week is left for the visit of the US President, according to sources. They said the deal between the two countries should be mutually beneficial and should not compromise India’s interest. “The US is adding more to its list of demands as trade talks are progressing,” they added. It is also not yet clear whether the US-India CEOs Forum will be convened during Trump’s two-day visit, beginning from February 24. The forum is a panel of CEOs that gives feedback to the US and Indian governments on the commercial relationship between the two countries. As the US is seeking greater market access for its dairy products, India has conveyed to them that dairy and milk products should not be derived from animals that are fed internal organs, blood meal, or tissues of ruminant origin as it would hurt sentiments of the society at large. On the other hand, India is seeking resumption of export incentives by the US, under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme. Under this programme, India had earlier exported goods worth USD 6.5 billion. So if the US would resume these incentives, it would seek greater market access equivalent to this amount at least. Under GSP, India was exporting 1,900 items from sectors like chemicals and engineering. It was rolled back by the US last year.',\n",
       " 'BHUBANESWAR: Acting with clinical precision, the Odisha Government on Monday empowered the State Commission for Backward Classes to conduct a survey on the social and educational conditions of the OBCs. The move which is reminiscent of the way Modi Government revoked special status to Jammu and Kashmir came after Odisha’s request was ignored by the Government of India. To the utter surprise of members, the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was introduced in the Assembly in the evening after a discussion on the motion of thanks for the Governor’s address was over. Earlier in the day, to facilitate amendment to the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993, a meeting of the State Cabinet was held in the morning at 9.45 am before the Assembly started. As the Bill was not listed for passing in the Assembly list of business for the day, Speaker Surya Narayan Patro convened the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) immediately by adjourning the house from 5.30 pm to 5.59 pm so that time can be allotted for the legislation. Leader of Opposition in the assembly Pradipta Kumar Naik and leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) Narasingh Mishra are among the members of the BAC. However, none of the ruling BJD or other Opposition members except the Leader of the Opposition or CLP leader was aware of what was going on in the corridors of power throughout the day. The entire exercise was over within 90 minutes in the assembly without giving the opposition members any time to react to the development. Though some Opposition Congress members including Santosh Singh Saluja and Tara Prasad Bahinipati opposed the hasty move and demanded that the Bill be deferred to be passed on Tuesday. But CLP leader and parliamentary affairs minister Bikram Keshari Arukha who explained that the Bill has to be passed today under special circumstances. Once budget will be placed in the Assembly on Tuesday, the Bill cannot be introduced in the house till the budget is passed, Mishra said. He also added that the aim is to exclude the creamy layer which is in line with the Supreme Court judgement. The Bill piloted in the house by Minister of State for ST and  SC Development, Minorities and Backward Classes Welfare Jagannath Saraka was passed in the House. Then, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik rose to move a resolution to take up survey of the backward classes which was another surprise but it was unanimously adopted. The resolution moved by the Chief Minister said that the state will do a survey of social and educational conditions of the people belonging to the backward classes. “We are commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. As a fitting tribute to Mahatma and his ideals, it is important that the state takes up the survey of the backward classes,” he said. The Chief Minister said the Odisha cabinet had resolved on January 11, 2020, to move the Centre to include backward class survey as part of the census 2021. “This has been formally moved by the state government to the Centre. Further, the issue has been raised both in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by BJD members. However, there has been no response,” he said. Describing the decision as historic, Chief Minister said the Assembly has resolved to amend the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act 1993, to enable the Backward Classes Commission constituted on February 12, 2020, to conduct a survey of the social and educational conditions of backward class people. The Chief Minister said to further accelerate inclusive growth in is important to have reliable data about backward classes of the state, but the last such census was done in 1931 which is now almost 90 years old. On Sunday night, a call went from Naveen Niwas to all BJD members to remain present in the House and while 99 per cent party MLAs were present, none had any inkling.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi or the Congress can never think of disrespecting former prime minister Manmohan Singh, the party said on Monday defending Gandhi’s act of tearing a copy of an ordinance in 2013. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Gandhi’s move of tearing the ordinance brought by the UPA government to allow those convicted in criminal cases to contest elections was a courageous step. His reaction came after former Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said after the Rahul Gandhi ordinance-trashing episode of 2013, Singh had asked him whether he thought he should resign as prime minister. “I do not know what was discussed between the two people. But, Rahul Gandhi has considered Dr Manmohan Singh as his guru and guide, neither Rahul Gandhi nor the Congress party can even think of disrespecting him,” Surjewala told reporters. He said when all parties in Parliament were with a majority trying to pass a legislation to grant pardon to all those who had cases against them, at that time one political leader displayed the strength to rise above party level in a bid to clean politics. “The issue is not tearing the paper but the issue is of clean politics and criminals should remain in politics,” he said. The Supreme Court had a day before the ordinance-trashing episode had issued directions to all parties to make public the cases against a candidate, Surjewala said. The former deputy chairman of the now-defunct Planning Commission, Ahluwalia had said he told Singh, who was then on a visit to the US, that he did not think a resignation on this issue was appropriate. In a major embarrassment to his own government, Gandhi had denounced the controversial ordinance brought by the UPA dispensation to negate a Supreme Court verdict on convicted lawmakers. He had termed it as “complete nonsense” that should be “torn up and thrown away”. Singh, while returning home from the US, had ruled out his resignation though he appeared piqued over the entire episode. “I was part of the PM’s delegation in New York and my brother Sanjeev, who had retired from the IAS, telephoned to say he had written a piece that was very critical of the PM. He had emailed it to me and said he hoped I didn’t find it embarrassing,” recalled Ahluwalia.',\n",
       " 'ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday urged the UN to fulfil its commitments with the people of Kashmir and help them achieve the right of self-determination as he met chief of the global body Antonio Guterres here. During his meeting with the UN Secretary-General, Prime Minister Khan highlighted the “dire human rights and humanitarian situation” in Jammu and Kashmir following India’s August 5 decision to end the special status of the region. “The Prime Minister underscored that the Kashmiri people continued to look to the United Nations to honour its commitments for the realisation of their right to self-determination, as enshrined in numerous UN Security Council resolutions,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after New Delhi ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year. India’s decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded its diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian envoy. India has defended its move, saying the special status provisions only gave rise to terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. “The country took the decision of abrogation of Article 370, which had only given separatism and terrorism to that state,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in October last year. India has rejected any third-party intervention to the Kashmir issue and has maintained that all outstanding matters in Indo-Pak ties should be resolved bilaterally. Khan claimed that India’s belligerent rhetoric, intensified ceasefire violations on the LoC, and other aggressive actions were imperilling peace and security in the region, the statement said. He also highlighted the possibility of a false flag operation by India to divert global attention from its “unacceptable actions” in Kashmir, it said. Talking about Afghanistan, Khan underscored that there was no military solution to the Afghan conflict and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast support for peace and reconciliation in the war-torn country. Khan also highlighted Pakistan’s generosity in hosting millions of Afghan refugees for the last four decades, the statement said. Earlier, Guterres and Khan attended the International Conference on 40 years of hosting Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The Prime Minister also stressed that climate change posed an existential threat to mankind and assured the Secretary-General that Pakistan would work for hand in hand with the global community to pursue swift implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement. He also highlighted the landmark ’10 billion Tree Tsunami’. Guterres also held talks with Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Monday.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: After the Supreme Court-appointed three interlocutors to try and persuade protesters at Shaheen Bagh to shift the protest site, the demonstrators said that moving to another area might weaken the agitation. “The main reason for blocking the road was to pressure the government but now if we go to an irrelevant place, I am not sure whether we could insist on our demands with same thrust or not,” said Nadeem Khan, one of the protesters. He said that the apex court should have asked the government to approach the protesters and address their demands instead of telling the protesters to vacate the road. Asif Mujtaba, a student of IIT Delhi, said that the road blockade happened to pressure the government in a peaceful manner by the sit-in protest.  However, Mujtaba hinted that there were high chances that the protesters at Shaheen Bagh would obey the top court’s orders and move the protest site. However, he said that a solution to the problem could be that the protesters would leave one side of the road for traffic while camping on the other side to continue their demonstration.  “We are glad that the SC has at least acknowledged that protest is our right and not asked us to call it off but just shift the site. There is a chance that the protesters reach a consensus with the court-appointed interlocutors. We are afraid that while there is the top court is seeing the legitimacy of our protest, the Delhi Police continues its stand that the protesters at Shaheen Bagh are using women and children as a shield,” he added.   The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by advocate Amit Sahni, who had approached the high court seeking directions to the Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which remains blocked by the anti-CAA protesters since December 15 last year.',\n",

They were found trespassing into Indian waters near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) by a patrol helicopter of the Indian Navy on Saturday. Four fishermen from Thangachimadam, who were reportedly to take delivery of the gold, have been detained for interrogation. According to sources, the helicopter from INS Parundu, during a surveillance sortie, spotted a fibre boat with three men aboard crossing the IMBL around 11 am on Saturday. Though the men tried to flee back to Sri Lanka, they were reportedly chased to the shores of Arichalmunai, where they were detained by the marine police later. The preliminary investigation identified the suspects as S Thomas Loius (31), A Suganth (26) and D Sahaya Vinistow (24) — all from Talaimannar of Sri Lanka. The men, believed to be fishermen by trade, were also questioned by the Dhanushkodi police and the Q-branch police. The trio were supposed to hand the smuggled gold over to four fishermen from Thangachimadam, added sources. Based on their statements, the four fishermen — Dhiyoni, Dhanushiyus, Lakshmanan and Sarveswaran — were detained for questioning. The gold, in 35 bars, had been stashed inside the rear of the fibre boat. The officials had to break the boat open to recover the gold, which was handed over to customs officials in Rameswaram on Sunday.',\n",

The Samsung Galaxy A70e’s renders have been leaked out in the wild by CompareRaja. The leaked image shows a whitish gradient rear panel housing three cameras aligned vertically on the top-left. Also, there is a fingerprint scanner at the center of the back panel. Moving to the front, the device can be seen sporting an Infinity-V display which is said to measure 6.5-inches. The bezels are narrow on three sides, except for the chin. But, it is unknown what kind of sensor will be packed inside the notch. The earpiece is neatly tucked above the notch. The leaked renders also show the placement of the ports and keys. While the power key is placed along with volume keys on the left, the right edge houses the SIM card tray. It remains to be seen if the company equips a hybrid or dedicated microSD card. At the bottom, there is the microUSB 2.0 port, while the 3.5mm headphone jack is placed on the top.

       " 'New Delhi: The Supreme Court said that the permanent service commission will apply to all women officers in the Army. This would be irrespective of their years of service, the court said while upholding the Delhi high court judgement of 2012. The court said that the centre’s submission that women are physiologically weak are based on a deeply entrenched stereotype that men are dominant and women are basically caretakers. The submission that taking care of family is a woman’s job is deeply disturbing, the court also said. It may be recalled that the court had been told that women may not be suitable for command posts in the Army. This is because the male troops are not yet prepared to accept women, the Centre had told the Supreme Court. Further, the dangers of women being taken prisoner of war was cited by the Centre. The composition of rank and file being made, and predominantly drawn from rural background, with prevailing societal norms, the troops are not yet mentally schooled to accept women officers in command, the government said. Further, male and female officers cannot be treated on par in the matter of postings because of their different physical standards and exposures, and reservations over exposing women officers to combat situations. Opposing the plea, the lawyers representing the women officers told the court that many of them displayed exceptional bravery in adverse situations. They said that it was Minty Agarwal as the flight controller who had guided Wing Commander Abhinandan when he shot down a Pakistani F-16. She was awarded the Yudh Seva Medal for this, the lawyers also contended. The Centre said that it is agreeable to the permanent commission to women officers who have served up to 14 years in the Army, but not above that. Those above 14 years of service will be permitted to serve till 20 years without PC and those past 20 years of services would be released with pensionary benefits. The Centre also said that the armed forces require sacrifices and commitment beyond the call of duty by the entire family of service personnel involving separation and frequent transfers, affecting the education of children and career prospects of the spouse. It is a challenge for women to meet these hazards of service owing to prolonged absence during pregnancy, motherhood and domestic obligations towards their children and families especially when both husband and wife happen to be service officers the centre also contended in the Supreme Court.',\n",

I’m trying to play aggressive tennis and looking to move top of the point and not defend so much. Also, I have been trying to stay healthy and that has been helpful.” On Sunday, the Australian didn’t have the greatest of starts. He was broken in the third game but fought back and broke back in the next game. While the trend continued with the players coming up with strong returns and struggling to hold serve, Duckworth managed to hold his in the eighth game and then broke Bonzi in the ninth to claim the set. The second set was the opposite. Both players served well and could not return as well as they wanted. An unforced error forced Bonzi to surrender the fifth game and while he managed to break back, a double fault at a crucial juncture cost him the seventh game. Duckworth fired three aces to take the 10th game, set and the match for his 11th Challenger title. “Bonzi had a great week and beat a lot of seeded players. I watched a bit of his footage and knew he was a tough opponent. As we both returned well, we also had to adjust to the conditions as the court was a bit slower than expected,” said Duckworth. “I am happy to have come out winner and pick up valuable ranking points. Overall, it was a good week.” Duckworth now wants to take the next step and play regularly in ATP 250 events and higher. For him, the next stop will be the Davis Cup (against Brazil). “Having been through what I have, I really appreciate what I have achieved. It feels a lot sweeter. I am looking forward to the Davis Cup. It was one of my goals. Now, with the rankings, I will be able to play a lot of ATP 250 tournaments. The target for the year will be to break into the top 50.”',\n",

       " 'LONDON: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Nicolas Pepe, Mesut Ozil and Alexandre Lacazette scored in the second half to give Arsenal a 4-0 victory over Newcastle on Sunday and end a run of four straight draws in the Premier League. The Gunners overcame a lifeless first half to record their first league win since New Year’s Day but they only rose to 10th place. Pepe claimed two assists, while Ozil scored his first goal since last April and Lacazette ended a nine-game drought. With Newcastle playing with a flat back five, the onus was on Arsenal to break them down. That only came after the break, with the hosts taking the lead in the 54th minute. Pepe twisted and turned in the area and pulled back to Eddie Nketiah, but the young striker’s 10-yard shot glanced off the top of the crossbar and went over. Shortly after, Aubameyang was in the perfect place to find the corner with a cushioned header from Pepe’s pinpoint cross. Pepe enjoyed a golden few minutes as three minutes later he got on the scoresheet to make it 2-0. This was down to the skill and enterprise of Bukayo Saka, who nutmegged Valentino Lazaro and teed up Pepe to sweep into the bottom corner. That seemed like that would be the end of the contest, but on another day Newcastle might have made a comeback. Only a brilliant block by Arsenal defender David Luiz denied Ciaran Clark while Allan Saint-Maximin, whose pace and energy was a threat throughout, struck a post with a curling shot. The hosts extended their lead to 3-0 in the 90th minute when Ozil slotted in from Lacazette’s assist. The Frenchman also ended a long wait for a goal as he struck for the first time in more than two months as he scuffed home another Pepe cross at the death. Newcastle is 13th, seven points above the relegation zone.',\n",

       " 'HYDERABAD: Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that no timeline has been decided yet regarding the removal of tax exemptions and making alternative tax rates that were announced in the Union Budget-2020 as is the norm. However, she added that the aim was to eventually have a “simplified, exemption-free tax regime with reduced rate of taxes” in the country. Speaking to the media here on Sunday, she said at the moment, the government has started an alternative tax rate regime with some exemptions removed or added, although the original intention was to remove all the exemptions and have a clear, simplified and reduced rate of income tax. She pointed out that in this alternative, the gradient of the increase in tax for different income slabs is gentle and there was no sharp increase. Sitharaman said the government did not compel anyone to leave tax exemptions and adopt the alternative tax regime, but for the sake of clarity it issued the complete matrix, to give an idea of an old system vis a vis the new system. Poor collection of GST compensation cess blamed for delay in dues to states She added that based on the simulations, it has been estimated that the alternative tax rates if it was implemented last year, would have benefitted around 69 per cent of the taxpayers while about 11 per cent would have adopted the new system. When asked about the lack of GST compensation devolution to Telangana, she said this problem was being faced by all the States and blamed it on the poor collection of GST compensation cess. As per the GST law, the Central government can devolve funds only through compensation cess. Regarding the decrease in devolution of share from Central taxes to the States from 42 per cent to 41 per cent, Sitharaman said the reason behind it was decreasing in the number of States by one and two new Union Territories coming into existence – Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.',\n",
       " 'BERLIN: Record high temperatures reportedly measured in Antarctica will take months to verify, the UN weather agency said Sunday. A spokesman for the World Meteorological Organization said the measurements made by researchers from Argentina and Brazil earlier this month have to undergo a formal process to ensure that they meet international standards. “A formal decision on whether or not this is a record is likely to be several months away,” said Jonathan Fowler, the WMO spokesman. Scientists at an Argentine research base measured a temperature of 18.3 degrees Celsius (nearly 65 degrees Fahrenheit) February 6 on a peninsula that juts out from Antarctica toward the southern tip of South America. The previous record there was 17.5 degrees celsius (63.5 degrees Fahrenheit) in March 2015. Last week, researchers from Brazil claimed to have measured temperatures of 20.75 degrees Celsius on an island off the peninsula beating the record for the entire Antarctic region of 19.8 Celsius in January 1982. Fowler said both of the new measurements would need to be transmitted to Prof. Randall Cerveny, a researcher at Arizona State University who examines reported temperature records for WMO. Cerveny then shares the data with a wider group of scientists who “will carefully evaluate the available evidence (including comparisons to surrounding stations) and debate the merits and problems of the observation,” said Fowler. The evaluation normally takes six to nine months, after which Cerveny would “formally either accept or reject the potential extreme,” giving official WMO approval to the new record, he said. Climate change is causing the Arctic and the Antarctic to warm faster than other parts of the planet.',\n",
       " 'KARACHI: The Asia Internet Coalition has urged the Pakistan government to revoke its newly-approved social media rules, warning that such regulations to control cyberspace will make it extremely difficult for companies to operate and cripple the country’s economy. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf government last week announced a new set of rules to regulate social media activity and has given all digital companies and social media platforms three months to adhere to the new rules. Under the new rules, social media companies will be obliged to disclose any information or data to a designated investigation agency, when sought. Failure to abide by any of the provisions will entail a fine of up to Rs 500 million. The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) is an industry association that comprises leading internet and technology companies, namely Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, AirBnb, Apple, Booking. com, Expedia Group, Grab, LinkedIn, LINE, Rakuten, and Yahoo. Managing Director AIC Jeff Paine said the government’s new rules to regulate social media activity will make it “extremely difficult” for digital companies to operate in Pakistan. In a letter sent to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and other senior officials dealing with technology and digital/social media, he said the new rules were against the basic right of expression and information. Paine warned that while members recognise Pakistan’s strong potential for investment and business, the sudden announcement of these rules belies the government of Pakistan’s claims that it is open for business and investment. “In fact, the rules as currently written would make it extremely difficult for AIC members to make their services available to Pakistani users and businesses,” he said. The letter also said that AIC was deeply concerned to see the Pakistan government release a set of broad-reaching online rules without any consultation with stakeholders, including the industry. Though the government has insisted that the new rules have been created for the protection of citizens, rights groups, media bodies and opposition members in Parliament have expressed concern that they are meant to curb freedom of expression and sharing of information. “We urge the government of Pakistan to consider the potential consequences of the rules in order to prevent unexpected negative impacts on Pakistan’s economy,” the letter said. It said the AIC members had been working in consultation with governments on this challenge for years, using both computer science tools and human reviewers to identify and stop a range of online abuse. The letter also observed that the rules were vague and arbitrary in nature, which was a result of the absence of public consultation. The lack of such discussion was problematic given that the rules demanded that social media companies deviate from established human rights practices concerning user privacy and freedom of expression. The letter said the way these rules were passed was causing international companies to re-evaluate their view of the regulatory environment in Pakistan, and their willingness to work and invest in the country. Under regulations that were approved by the Cabinet late last month but were not immediately made public, social media companies will be obliged to help law enforcement agencies access data and to remove online content deemed unlawful. The new set of rules were approved at a cabinet meeting without being brought up in Parliament for discussion. AIC seeks to promote the understanding of Internet policy issues in the Asia-Pacific region.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON: A senior US health official said Sunday that more than 40 Americans on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have been infected with the deadly coronavirus and would not be a part of an evacuation effort. “Forty of them have gotten infected,” Anthony Fauci, a senior official at the National Institutes for Health said on CBS’ Face the Nation show. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Saturday that 400 Americans on the Diamond Princess cruise ship would be evacuated and flown back to the United States where they would face a 14-day quarantine period. But Fauci said that those confirmed with infections would not be allowed to fly. “They are not going to go anywhere,” he said. “They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan.” Asked about the severity of the infected Americans’ illness, Fauci said it varied. “You could be infected and have minimal symptoms, but you still have the possibility of transmitting it to someone else,” he said. “Or you could be infected and have some significant lung disease that would require hospitalization and perhaps even some serious intervention.” He added that anyone showing potential symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, would also not be able to get on evacuation planes. “If people on the plane start to develop symptoms, they’ll be segregated within the plane. So there’s a very firm plan with this 747 that is going to take these passengers now who have been there.” Some American passengers from the cruise ship have indicated they would decline to be evacuated because they were asymptomatic. But Fauci said everyone who had been on the ship would still be subject to quarantine on their return to the US. “And the reason for that is that the degree of transmissibility on that cruise ship is essentially akin to being in a hot spot. A lot of transmissibility on that cruise ship,” he explained. More than 1,600 people have died from the novel coronavirus in China since it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan, and five others have died outside China. The US has enacted a temporary travel ban on foreign nationals who have visited China and quarantine measures for its own citizens returning from the province at the epicenter of the outbreak.',\n",

Brushing aside reports of any differences between the two, he said all party leaders are working for the welfare of the people and for providing good governance in Madhya Pradesh. Both Nath and Scindia attended the coordination committee meeting on Saturday and it ended on a “very cordial” note, the Congress general secretary said. Babaria said a meeting of the Coordination Committee and the Manifesto Implementation Committee, of which former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan is the chairman, would be held later this month to work out the implementation of pending promises. Scindia has of late threatened to take to the streets if his party’s government in Madhya Pradesh failed to meet the demands of protesting guest teachers, with Chief Minister Kamal Nath virtually daring him to do so. After the coordination committee meeting on Saturday, Nath when asked about Scindia’s threat said, “Toh woh utar jaaye (let him do so).” The coordination committee meeting was convened by Deepak Babaria and top leaders, including former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh, were present. While party leaders claim there are no factions within the state Congress, Scindia has often taken on the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, a move considered as a result of friction within the state unit. Scindia had lost the Lok Sabha election from his Guna constituency and is now considered a hot favourite for the Rajya Sabha from the state.',\n",

This new brand of politics is already being talked about all over the country. It will help create the India of the 21st century,” Kejriwal said, hinting at plans to go national with his development model. Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already announced its intention to fight every local body poll across the nation. It also hopes to wrest control of the Municipal Corporation in Delhi from the BJP. Party leaders from across the country gathered at CM’s residence in the evening to deliberate upon expanding the AAP’s national footprint. Waving the Tricolour and carrying placards, thousands gathered at the iconic ground to catch a glimpse of Kejriwal, who overcame incumbency and scored a landslide in the Assembly polls last week, picking up 62 seats in the 70-member House. In a contrast to the swearing-in ceremony in 2015, Kejriwal this time spoke about taking everyone along for the development of Delhi and forgiving the Opposition for its sharp language in the run up to the elections. “I forgive all my opponents for their remarks against me. I want to take everyone along. I will not work alone but with all of you,” said Kejriwal. “I have never discriminated against them in the last five years. I have worked for everybody, and never discriminated against people who did not vote for me.” It was an AAP-only show as no Opposition biggies were invited. However, BJP MLA from Rohini Vijendra Gupta was present. According to sources, the AAP did not want to turn it into an Opposition unity event, since it would have made the messaging combative instead of the positive tone the party intended to have. That strategy was reflected in Kejriwal seeking PM Narendra Modi’s blessings for smooth governance. The PM reciprocated by extending his best wishes for a fruitful tenure. Kejriwal thanked Modi, adding: “We must now work together towards making Delhi a city of pride for all Indians.”',\n",

The national leadership of the party has asked its Bengali unit to identify civic issues which could be highlighted in the canvassing phase, a BJP source in Kolkata said. “A review of our Delhi performance has revealed that we suffered badly in pockets home to Bengali-speaking community such as Karol Bagh, Chittaranjan Park, Greater Kailash and Kalkaji. We trailed AAP by huge margins in these areas. We fared poorly despite the fact that our Bengal MPs, as well as youth wing workers from the state, had campaigned extensively in these areas in support of CAA. The results clearly show that our effort came to naught. Our national leadership has now directed to us to build our municipal poll campaign around local issues,” a senior BJP leader said. “Voters in semi-urban areas are playing into fears being spread around the CAA and NRC. This is a direct fallout of the ruling party’s (TMC’s) misleading campaign. We have been asked to raise local issues and build pressure on the ruling party. We have to identify the civic amenities that people are being deprived of. While we’ll raise the CAA in our campaign, it won’t figure among the big talking points,” he added.

I am sure the government also expected some backlash from some countries and were prepared to handle the situation,” a research scholar from the Indian Council for World Affairs said. Apart from Pakistan and China, countries like Malaysia and Turkey have been fiercely critical of the BJP government’s decision to repeal Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into two union territories. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has more than once voiced his opinion against the government’s decision, including at the United Nations General Assembly in September. “The reaction to Malaysia’s criticism was seen in the commerce ministry notification of placing palm oil on the restricted items list. In my opinion, it also evinced the intended reaction from Malaysia.

Former BJP chief Amit Shah had appointed Jabalpur MP Rakesh Singh as the state unit chief of Madhya Pradesh a few months before the state Assembly elections. Though Singh along with the former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan hailed from the OBC background, Shah has gone away with aggressive bid to win over the backward castes. However, the gamble didn’t pay the electoral dividends. The upper castes had backed the Congress, allowing the party to wrest power in the state. With Sharma as the Brahmin face, the BJP is hoping to win back the electorally influential caste. Besides, Nadda in his choices for MP and Kerala has shown that he would be backing younger generation to take over the leadership role in states, with the party bracing up for expansion of support base, particularly the youth. Surendran had made a name for himself with the party led agitation against the Left government on Sabarimala issue. Coming from the ABVP background, Surendran is the BJP’s long-term investment to build a strong base in the state where the saffron outfit wants to win support base on a long term, capitalising on the groundwork done by the Rashtriya Swayam Sewak Sangh (RSS).

Considering the crisis that the industry is faced with, FADA said it is a ‘tough task’ to sell 100 per cent of the BS-IV vehicles currently in stock with its members in less than two months. “FADA, hence, appeals to all OEMs (original equipment manufactures) to shift completely to BS-VI vehicles for all wholesale despatches to dealers and stop further billing of BS-IV vehicles with immediate effect to dealers, thereby helping liquidation of the current BS-IV inventory for a smoother transition to BS-VI,” FADA president Ashish Kale said in a statement. The counsel appearing for FADA cited the slowdown in the automobile industry and urged the court to extend the deadline by a month. “Kindly allow us to sell BS-IV vehicles to clear the stock,” argued the lawyer. However, a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said that the court would not extend the deadline even for a day. The bench said the order was passed by the apex court one and a half years ago. “You should not have produced BS-IV vehicles after that. Even after filing this application, you have produced these vehicles,” the bench said. In its October 2018 order, the apex court observed that any extension in this case would further worsen the health of the citizens, as the pollution levels have become critical. Meanwhile, in an internal message circulated to dealers, the FADA president also advised dealers to plan liquidation of BS-IV inventory as per March 31 deadline for the sale and registration of BS-IV vehicles.  The stricter Bharat Stage (BS) VI emission norms come into effect from April this year.',\n",

In the Union Budget 2020-21, the government has raised the farm loan disbursal target by 11 per cent to `15 lakh crore for the next fiscal and allocated `1.6 lakh crore to implement various plans in agriculture and allied sectors as it chases the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022. The farm credit target for the current fiscal had been set at `13.5 lakh crore. “Credit limit has been expanded. I am sure it is based on local ground level requirement. We expect the demand to grow and credit requirements to also meet this demand. I am closely monitoring banks and their extension of credit facilities, particularly to rural areas,” she told reporters after attending the RBI’s central board meeting. The government has also allocated `75,000 crore for the PM-KISAN scheme for the next fiscal, the same as the budget estimate for the ongoing fiscal year but higher than revised estimate of `54,370 crore.

       " 'New Delhi: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday said momentum is gathering pace on credit growth and expressed hope that transmission of rate cuts will improve further in the coming days. His comments come against the backdrop of concerns over growth of the economy, which has also registered spike in inflation and slowdown in industrial production. Addressing the media after RBI board meeting, which was also addressed by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Das said he does not agree that rate cut transmission is plateauing out. Transmission of rate cuts is slowly and steadily improving and it is expected to improve further, he said. “We do expect credit growth to pick up in coming months,” Das said, adding that momentum is gathering pace on this front. On February 6, the six member-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by Das, for the second meeting in a row, kept repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent but maintained the accommodative policy stance which implies it was biased in favour of cutting rate to boost growth. “Monetary policy framework is in operation for the last 3 years. Internally, we are reviewing and analysing how the has worked. At an appropriate time, if required, we’ll have dialogue and discussion with the government. At the moment it is under review within RBI,” the RBI governor said. He further added that RBI’s growth projection of 6 per cent for the next year is in line with Economic Survey projection. Prior to going for status quo on rates in December, the central bank had slashed rates five consecutive times that resulted in a cumulative 1.35 per cent decline in repo rate. “Economic activity remains subdued and the few indicators that have moved up recently are yet to gain traction in a more broad-based manner. Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to maintain status quo,” the MPC had said. On Supreme Court’s order to telecom companies regarding AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues, Das said it will have internal discussions in case there are any issues arising out of the order. The RBI governor did not offer any specific comments about the order — which might have ramifications on banks in terms of their exposure to the financially-stressed telecom companies.

Bartholomew Ogbeche (45th, 72nd minutes) scored a brace to take his tally to 13 goals this season, while Deshorn Brown (16th) was the lone scorer for Bengaluru FC. Bengaluru FC have already secured their place in the playoffs, sitting pretty at the third spot with 19 points from 17 games while Kerala are placed seventh with 18 points from as many matches. Bengaluru, on their return to league action after a thumping win against Paro FC in the AFC Cup, showed no signs of fatigue in the early stages of the game. The visitors had their first opening in the fifth minute when Nishu Kumar’s lob into the box found Udanta Singh, who shot wide from close-range. The visitors soon opened the scoring when Suresh Wangjam released Deshorn Brown into space with a long pass that carved open the Kerala defence.

While Mayank and Pant shared a 100-run partnership (134 runs for the third wicket), Prithvi Shaw scored a quickfire 39 off 31 balls. Even Wriddhiman Saha didn’t do his reputation any harm as he hit an unbeaten 30 off 38 balls. But Shubman Gill couldn’t make much of the opportunity as he managed just 8.

       " 'TOKYO: Americans will be removed from a cruise ship quarantined off Japan and flown home, the US embassy said Saturday as dozens more cases of the new coronavirus were diagnosed on board. At least 285 people on the Diamond Princess have contracted the illness but hundreds of passengers and crew have not yet been tested as they wait in a quarantine that was scheduled to end February 19. In a message to Americans, the embassy said the US government “recommends, out of an abundance of caution, that US citizens disembark and return to the United States for further monitoring”. The remarks were later echoed by a US state department spokesperson, who confirmed that US citizens should return. The embassy warned that those who come back will have to undergo another 14 days of quarantine when they arrive in the United States. A chartered flight will arrive in Japan on Sunday, but it was not immediately clear when it would leave. The message said the flight will land at Travis Air Force Base in California, with some passengers continuing to a second air base in Texas. Japanese public broadcaster NHK said 400 Americans were on board the cruise ship and the plane would leave Tokyo’s Haneda airport as soon as early Monday. “Passengers will be screened for symptoms and we are working with our Japanese partners to ensure that any symptomatic passengers receive the required care in Japan if they cannot board the flight,” the message said. “Should you choose not to return on this charter flight, you will be unable to return to the United States for a period of time,” it warned. The Japanese government was arranging special embarkation procedures for US citizens taking the chartered flight, an official said, adding that “a certain number” of other countries have also shown interest in similar evacuation measures. While some Americans on the ship have urged their government to extract them from the boat, others on board criticised the plan. “Incredibly disappointed that the US Government has decided to throw a monkey wrench into the quarantine we have maintained here on board the Diamond Princess,” tweeted Matt Smith, an American lawyer. “The US Government wants to take us off without testing, fly us back to the US with a bunch of other untested people, and then stick us in 2 more weeks of quarantine? How does that make any sense at all?” There were more than 3,700 people on the ship when it arrived off the Japanese coast in early February. It was placed in quarantine after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the newly named COVID-19. Those diagnosed on board have been removed to local hospital, with people remaining on the ship told that their quarantine would be over on February 19, two weeks from when it officially began. But a message broadcast on the ship by the captain on Saturday night cast doubt on that timeline. “The Japanese government has informed us that they may start a new testing process for guests beginning February 18,” the message said, warning that it would take several days to complete and results would not be available for around three days. “So guests who are tested on February 18 and have negative test results may be able to disembark beginning February 21,” the message said. He added that those who had close contact with anyone who tested positive would have to restart their quarantine from the date of their last close contact. And crew on board will go into a new quarantine period once the passengers have left the ship, though details of how long that would last were not immediately clear, the broadcast said. Japan’s government has begun allowing elderly passengers on the ship in poor health to leave and finish their quarantine on land. Those on board have been mostly confined to their cabins and required to wear masks and keep their distance from others during brief outings on deck. On Saturday, the health ministry confirmed another 12 infections in Japan, including taxi drivers in Tokyo and patients at a western Japanese hospital where two doctors have already tested positive. Excluding the cases on the ship, and an infected quarantine officer, Japanese authorities have so far diagnosed at least 52 people with the virus, which has killed more than 1,500 and infected at least 66,000 in China.',\n",

More than 450 civilians were killed in central Mali last year by armed groups, making it the deadliest year in the region since the country’s crisis began in 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. Ethnic clashes have been ongoing and exploited by Islamic extremists who have been recruiting men from the Peuhl ethnic group to their cause.

       " 'NAGPUR: Congress national spokesperson Anshul Avijit on Saturday said the BJP and the Sangh Parivar were “anti-Dalit” and were working to remove reservations for SC/STs in government jobs. Addressing a press conference here, he said the BJP government at the Centre had hatched a “sinister conspiracy” to remove reservations. “The testimony of this sinister attempt is the plea of BJP government in Uttarakhand in the Supreme Court that there was no fundamental right of reservation in government jobs for SC/STs,” he said. In a judgement on February 7, the SC held that states are not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions. The apex court said this while dealing with pleas regarding Uttarakhand government’s September 5, 2012 decision to fill up all posts in public services in the state without providing reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. “Instead of apologising to the nation for this conspiracy and correcting the historical wrong being done to SC/STs, the Narendra Modi government is misleading the country by making false accusations,” he alleged. He said that the RSS had, in the past, demanded a review of the quota system in the country. Citing statistics, he said the number of atrocities on Dalits as per NCRB data was 43,203 for the year 2017, adding that the Congress under Rahul Gandhi would fight to ensure Dalits and other deprived classes get their due.',\n",

However, the company reiterated its survival depends on relief, without which it may well find itself winding down operations or approaching the insolvency court. If that happens, it would have far-reaching consequences, considering VIL’s substantial debt exposure to banks and the jobs of nearly 10,000 employees. According to SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, banks will “have to pay the price” in case any telecom firm files for bankruptcy. While the DoT had shot off notices to all affected companies following the SC’s outrage on Friday, asking them to clear the dues by midnight, it was an impossible deadline for the non-compliant telcos. None of them managed to make any payments so far. “(VIL) is currently assessing the amount that it will be able to pay to DoT towards the dues calculated based on AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue), as interpreted by the SC in its order dated October 24, 2019. The company proposes to pay the amount so assessed in the next few days,” VIL said in an exchange filing. However, the telecom major repeated that its ability to operate as a going concern “is essentially dependent on a positive outcome of the application for modification” of the SC’s order asking telcos to pay around Rs 1.47 lakh crore in pending AGR dues by January 23. Of the 15 companies, only Reliance Jio had complied on time, paying around `190-odd crore before the deadline. “If there is a negative impact on any enterprise, it impacts a larger ecosystem, whether it is banks, whether it is employees, whether they are vendors, consumers, so everybody gets impacted,” warned SBI’s chairman. He said his bank said is in the “wait-and-watch mode” regarding the AGR matter. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das told reporters that the central bank will have internal discussions in case there are any issues arising out of the AGR crisis. The SC has warned of contempt proceedings against top executives of telcom firms if they fail to comply with its directive.

       " 'NEW DELHI:  If the number of students showing interest in seeking admission in the country’s engineering colleges is any indication, then the great Indian fetish to become an engineer is on the downswing. The dream to become a doctor is the new fad. Data compiled by the National Testing Agency that organizes entrance tests for engineering and medical colleges shows that while 8.69 lakh students had registered for the first JEE Main this year, the number was nearly 16 lakh for NEET, scheduled to be held in May. The JEE (Main) is organised twice a year while NEET, the test for admission into medical colleges, is held once a year. “Despite the JEE-Main being conducted twice, there has been a decline of nearly 33 per cent in candidates interested to get into engineering colleges since 2014 while there has been a surge of about 140 per cent in those who are keen to get into medical colleges,” pointed out Prerna Samarth, a Mumbai based high education consultant. Statistics show that the engineering vs medical trend began to change in the last six years. In 2014, the number of students who took entrance tests for admission in engineering colleges was 12.90 lakh while medical aspirants numbered only 6.16 lakh, more than double. But in subsequent years the gap began to narrow and two years back, the number of students wanting admission in medical colleges surpassed engineering hopefuls. Data for this year shows the change in preference has turned a full circle, with double the number of medical aspirants. “This is because the engineering sector has probably gone bust with a huge gap in supply and demand and low quality of training imparted in most engineering college,” said Amit Gupta, who trains students to crack the NEET examination in Kota. “The opportunities for medical aspirants, on the other hand, have immensely increased and while it is still tough to secure an MBBS seat in India, it’s not as difficult as it was 10 years ago. Also, doctors have an added advantage of self-employment later, something that engineers don’t,” he added. Gupta’s assertion is supported by figures. The number of MBBS seats increased by nearly 48 per cent since 2014-15. It was 54,348 six years back, which reached 80,312 in 2019-20. It is expected to go up further in the coming session. The data by the All-India Council for Technical Education shows that the total intake in B Tech and B E programmes has gone down from over 17.3 lakh to 13 lakh in the same period. “The quality of engineering education is a concern.

       " 'NEW DELHI:  All hopes of judicial relief turned to ashes for India’s incumbent telecom majors on Friday in the face of the Supreme Court’s fiery indignation over non-compliance of its orders in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case. Heading a three-judge bench, Justice Arun Mishra launched into a furious tirade pulling up both the companies and the Department of Telecom (DoT) for violating its order mandating January 23 as the deadline for payment of Rs1.47 lakh crore in AGR dues. The SC’s anger saw the DoT hastily reverse a previous order asking officials not to take “coercive action” against non-compliant telcos and directing the telcos to clear their dues by 11.59 pm on Friday. AGR is the basis on which levies like licence fees and spectrum usage charges are calculated and the SC had ruled last year this should include proceeds from licence-holders’ non-telecom businesses, too. Petitioners Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices collectively owe over Rs1 lakh crore to the government, according to DoT estimates. Only Reliance Jio complied with the SC direction on time, paying Rs190 crore dues. “We have dismissed review plea in adjusted gross revenue case, but still not a single penny has been deposited… Is this not about money power?” thundered Mishra. The SC’s anger was directed in large part toward the DoT’s order asking officials not to take any coercive action against non-compliant telcos. “A desk officer is sitting in appeal over our orders!… If a desk officer has the audacity to stay a Supreme Court order, then let’s wind up the Supreme Court!” said Mishra. The officer’s “temerity” in passing the order was “nothing but a device to scuttle” the SC’s direction, the bench observed. “Who is sponsoring all this? At whose behest he did this? Should we say this officer was hand in gloves with those who didn’t want to pay?” Mishra asked. The hearing culminated in the SC drawing up contempt of court proceedings against the DoT officer and directing the directors of non-compliant telcos to show cause by the next hearing on March 17 as to why similar action should not be taken against them.

Sources in the ministry said a Congress-era Bill, tabled in Parliament during the PV Narasimha Rao government in 1992, is now being studied to “assess its feasibility in present times.” The then 79th Constitution Amendment Bill, introduced by Health Minister ML Fotedar, had proposed amendments in Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties to promote population control. The Bill had stipulated amendment to the Direct Principles of State Policy (Article 47) to provide that “state shall endeavour to promote population control” and include the promotion and adoption of the small family norm by citizens as one of the fundamental duties (Article 51 A). The Bill, however, could not move beyond the discussion stage at that time. “At the moment, we are holding discussions on the Bill that had been prepared nearly 30 years ago.

This newspaper had earlier reported that after Prime Minister Narendra Modi underlined the need for population control in his Independence Day speech last year, the Niti Aayog too has been examining past and existing examples of population control measures adopted by various states and holding discussions. “Nothing is concrete as of now but there could be something in the offing in the near future,” another official in the health ministry said. The development comes amid the introduction of a private member Bill in the Rajya Sabha last week which had also proposed a constitutional amendment for the government to provide incentives in taxation, employment and education for population control.

But looks like the spying chat app was found back on the Store. Google notes that it’s been removed once again now. ToTok is a chat app, not to be confused with the popular TikTok app. ToTok is used as a spying tool for the United Arab Emirates. It was first spotted by the New York Times, who said that the app “seemed like a popular chat app. It’s secretly a spy tool”. It appears that Google had quietly reinstated the app in January. ToTok remains unavailable on the App Store since the first takedown. A report from 9to5Google notes that the app was taken down earlier today (February 15). Google has refrained from explaining why the app was taken down the second time. An even bigger question is why did Google reinstate the app. The Android creator had removed ToTok from the Play Store for the first time because it violated unspecified policies. After reports of the spying chat app surfaced, Google had taken immediate action. ToTok is a messaging app that was available on both the Play and the App Store. It promised “fast, free, and secure” messages and calls. It was downloaded by millions of citizens in the UAE and other regions in the Middle East. What’s interesting is that just before it was removed from the Play Store and the App Store in December last year, it was one of the most-downloaded social media apps in the US as well. The NYT investigative report revealed that the app was allowing the UAE government to spy on the users, including sensitive information and chat messages. At that time, ToTok denied the allegations and said that it not only does it “respect privacy and ensure security, our users also have the complete control over what data they want to share at their own discretion.”',\n",

Overconsumption of iron can also be dangerous for our body as it increases the risk of heart failure, liver diseases, diabetes and metabolic syndrome to name a few. Iron overload in our body is also the main cause of the onset of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and epilepsy. Elevated levels of iron in our body can be due to: genetic disorders, more iron shots/injection, increased consumption of iron-rich foods or intake, or iron supplements in a large amount. Here are some of the risks associated with iron overconsumption. 1. Iron toxicity It is caused mainly due to overdose of iron supplements. In such cases, iron gets accumulated in the vital organs like liver and brain and cause lethal damage to them. Symptoms of iron toxicity include nausea, stomach pain and vomiting. 2. Colon Cancer Too much iron has a carcinogenic potential to cause colon cancer. It is caused due to uncontrolled Fenton reaction in the presence of excess iron in the body. This promotes gene instability and mutation, leading to cancer. [1] 3. Hemochromatosis It is a hereditary disorder caused due to excess deposition of iron in the body which eventually leads to cell death and cause multiple organ dysfunction. Symptoms are discolouration of the skin and diseases related to the pancreas. [2] 4. Diabetes High levels of dietary iron in the body are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Iron is also a nutrient that helps in regulating metabolism. When the count of iron goes up in the body, conditions like insulin resistance and beta-cell failure occur – the main cause of diabetes. [3] 5. Heart Attack Iron overload in the body may cause heart-related disorders like cardiac hemochromatosis. In this condition, excess of iron gets accumulated in the heart causing organ toxicity and dysfunction. This leads to congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat. [4] 6. Liver Cancer According to a hypothesis, iron overload is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, commonly known as liver cancer. The condition is developed due to an increase in the dietary intake of iron. [5] 7. Alzheimer’s DIsease Excessive iron deposition in the brain leads to the formation of an abnormal protein that gets accumulated inside specific regions of the brain related to memory and promote the development of Alzheimer’s disease.

       " 'Right from his debut film Masaan, Vicky Kaushal has always enthralled the audience with his heartfelt performances in his films. However, it was Aditya Dhar’s Uri: The Surgical Strike which proved to be a turning point for him. The film was one of the biggest blockbusters of 2019 and even helped Vicky to bag the National Award for Best Actor. Recently, there were reports floating in the media about the actor hiking his remuneration after delivering this huge hit at the box office. Recently when Filmibeat caught up with Vicky during the promotions of his upcoming film, Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship, the actor reacted to these reports. Vicky told us, ‘Mujhe chulha bhi toh jalana hai’ (jokes) It’s not like I have hiked my remuneration. It’s just that sometimes, you take you films which you wrap up in 20 days and then, there are some films where you devote a lot of months. When you are investing so much and giving that much time to prep as well, then the logistics should be accordingly to that. At the end of the day, you are selling your services. So, we don’t have fixed pay cheques. It’s not like, if you give a successful film, you hike your remuneration. There are other logistical reasons as well due to which the amount keeps changing. It increases as well as decreases. But, people always talk about the hike.” Talking about how Uri: The Surgical Strike’s success was a highlight in his career, the actor said, “It has been a beautiful year. There was a time when I was even ready to pay to get work, and now I am receiving so much love. Producers can also rely on me now and I am getting work. Also, I am getting to work with filmmakers with whom it was my dream to work, which feels great. Also, my self confidence has increased and I feel, yes I am on the right track. Uri was made by a debutante filmmaker. I had never played a solo lead before this film. So, I had a huge responsibility on my shoulders. But because the film clicked, the audience accepted it. As long as the script works for you, you must go for it. You never know what the next Friday might bring for you. The industry is going through a beautiful phase where people are not just dependent of the film’s packaging. If the content in your film is good, there’s an audience for it. People will buy the tickets and go, watch and support your film.” He further added, “It’s been a great year for me after Uri: The Surgical Strike. People have showered me with love. It feels like they have snatched the film from us and made it their own. More than the box office numbers and awards, that feeling was more special for us. You feel more happy about your success when you see that happiness reflecting in your parents’ eyes. When you see your parents sitting back and enjoying that success, it feels good. My dad has struggled a lot in his life. His only regret in life is that my grandfather wasn’t there to enjoy his good phase. I feel good that now when my time is good, my parents are there with me to see that time. I feel, God has been kind.” In the same interview, Vicky told us that he is eager to overcome his fear of ghosts and revealed that he feels jealous of people who don”t feel scared to watch horror movies. The actor confessed, “I would love to overcome that fear because I get very jealous of people who say we really enjoy horror films. I wonder don”t they feel scared at night? If I see something in the kitchen in a horror film, I would probably see the same thing in my kitchen in real life! And it becomes difficult to sleep alone at night.”',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI:  India’’s telecom sector is just a stone’s throw away from becoming a duopoly after the Supreme Court dismissed last-ditch pleas for relief from telcos on Friday. The move places a question mark over the survival of Vodafone Idea (VIL), which repeatedly warned that it may not be able to continue as a going concern in the absence of relief. VIL did not respond to requests for comment. If VIL exits, it will leave just Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio in effective competition, since state-run BSNL-MTNL remains in the doldrums. Analysts say VIL’s cash flow and balances indicate that it will not be able to meet its liabilities of Rs53,000 crore in one-go. “Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the positive outcome of the modification application filed in the apex court and the subsequent agreement with DoT for payment in instalments after some moratorium and other reliefs,” VIL had said just a day earlier, announcing a net loss of Rs6,439 crore for the quarter ended December 2019. Vodafone Idea’s promoter groups — Vodafone Plc and the Aditya Birla Group — have also effectively ruled out any further capital infusion in the Indian company.',\n",
       " 'BAMAKO (Mali): Twenty people were killed in an attack overnight on a village in central Mali, local officials said Friday, in an apparent spate of ethnic violence in the deeply troubled region. The attack occurred in Ogossagou, a village mainly inhabited by Fulani people where around 160 died last March in a massacre blamed on Dogon militiamen. About 30 gunmen carried out the new attack, village chief Aly Ousmane Barry told AFP. “I counted the numbers while soldiers and the medical services were there,” he said. “We have 20 dead. Some of them have been burned.” A local government official, who requested anonymity, earlier confirmed that the attack took place and gave a toll of 11. He said that the attackers moved in several hours after government troops had pulled out of the area. Central Mali has been torn by ethnic violence as a result of a jihadist revolt that broke out in the north of the country in 2012. The insurgency has claimed thousands of lives and spread to neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso. Tit-for-tat attacks in central Mali flared after Fulani people, also called Peul, became associated with jihadists. Led by a firebrand Islamic preacher Amadou Koufa, a militia called the Katiba Macina recruited members from among the Fulani and became accused of ethnically-motivated attacks. Other ethnic groups such as the Bambara or the Dogon began to form self-defence groups that in turn became accused of reprisal massacres. In addition to the latest attack at Ogossagou, 14 Fulani were killed in central Mali in January. Around 75 Dogons were killed in the villages of Sobane Da, Gangafani and Yoro in June last year, in an attack blamed on Fulani militants. Human Rights Watch this month pointed to the ethnic patchwork of central Mali as the country’s “epicentre” of violence. It said over 450 civilians had been killed in the region in 2019, “the deadliest year for civilians” since the jihadist insurgency began. Reflecting the chronic instability in the centre, Malian soldiers are themselves frequently targeted. On Friday, one soldier was killed in an attack on a military camp in Mondoro, security officials said. It had already been hit before — as part of a joint raid by militants that also targeted the military camp of Boulkessy near the border with Burkina Faso, killing at least 25 soldiers. On January 26, Al-Qaeda-linked militants attacked a military camp in Sokolo, central Mali, killing 20 gendarmes and wounding five more. The violence in central Mali coincides with renewed hopes that the fragile government can reassert control over the widely lawless north. Troops returned on Thursday to Kidal, a northern town that had been a bastion of Touareg rebels, after a six-year absence. Regular forces returned to the town accompanied by former rebels who have been integrated into the army under a regional peace agreement. The deal, reached in Algiers in 2015, is considered one of the few avenues Mali has for escaping the cycle of violence.',\n",
       " 'BERLIN: Police in Germany arrested twelve men, including one of its own officers, in a nationwide probe into an extreme-right group suspected of planning attacks on politicians, asylum-seekers and Muslims, state interior ministry sources and prosecutors said Friday. The arrests followed raids, some by heavily-armed special units, which hit 13 locations in six German states. The four prime suspects planned to spark “a civil-war-like situation… via as yet undefined attacks on politicians, asylum seekers and people of Muslim faith,” federal prosecutors said in a statement. A further eight suspects were alleged to have agreed to “financially support the group, provide it with weapons or take part in future attacks”. The twelve included a police officer previously suspended over suspicions he had links to the far-right, a source at the interior ministry in North-Rhine Westphalia state told AFP, though it was not immediately clear if he was one of the prime suspects. From its founding in September 2019, the group’s ultimate aim was “to shake the state and social order in Germany and in the end to overturn it,” investigators believe. In order to plan their attacks, the group allegedly held regular meetings which were coordinated and organised by two of the main suspects, named only as Werner S. and Tony E. The suspects, all of whom are German citizens, also communicated using messenger apps. Investigators launched Friday’s raids to determine whether the suspects already had weapons or other supplies that could be used in an attack. The twelve men are set to appear before a court on Friday or Saturday to hear whether they will be imprisoned on remand. German authorities have turned increased attention to the country’s underground extreme right scene since the murder of conservative local politician Walter Luebcke last June and an October attack on a synagogue in eastern city Halle. Suspects arrested in both cases have ties to the extreme right. According to Spiegel magazine, police discovered several weapons in Friday’s raids, including one self-made “slam gun” similar to the one used in the Halle attack. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer announced in December 600 new posts across the federal police and domestic security services to track far-right extremist threats, citing a growing danger. At the time, federal police said they had identified 48 people on the extreme right as “dangerous” individuals who could carry out an attack. Reacting to reports of the arrests on Friday, a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said that measures to protect religious institutions would be reviewed by local authorities. A spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, said that threats to attack Islamic institutions in Germany amounted to “abominable behaviour”. “We as the federal government feel an obligation to ensure that anyone in Germany can practice their religion within the bounds of our legal order,” said Steffen Seibert at a government press conference.',\n",

The coronavirus has posed a big threat to the medical staff in China as more than 1,700 Chinese health workers have been infected by the virus while treating the patients and six of them have died. The worst-hit Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan reported 116 new fatalities on Thursday, lower than the highest toll of 242 on Wednesday. The province reported 4,823 new confirmed cases on Thursday. Overall death toll in China has climbed to 1,488 while the total number of cases have increased to 64,894 as of Thursday, according to health officials. On Friday, the Chinese government highlighted the continued drop of coronavirus disease, officially termed by the WHO as COVID-19, all over the country except in Hubei province. The cases in rest of China other than Hubei declined for the 10th day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told online media briefing. He also said Chinese hospitals discharge 6,723 recovered patients of coronavirus infection. This reportedly included the whistleblower Chinese doctor Li Wenliang who was reprimanded by police for alerting about the virus over the social media in December last. Considering the plight of the medical workers, Chinese authorities have allocated USD 3.71 billion to improve their working conditions. Ou Wenhan, assistant minister of finance told the media here the money will be used to purchase medical equipment and protective materials and upgrade facilities in medical institutions. Each frontline medical and epidemic prevention worker would receive a subsidy of 300 yuan or 200 yuan per day according to different risk levels, Ou said.

       " 'NEW DELHI: An armed forces tribunal has come down hard on the Indian Navy for arbitrarily denying promotion to an officer posted on board nuclear submarine INS Chakra, and ordered it to elevate him to rank of a Captain though he has already taken premature retirement from the service. The Navy was also directed to pay financial dues to Commander SS Luthra who was among a select group of officers selected to serve on board India’s nuclear submarines after a lengthy training in Russia, officials said. In 2017, the tribunal imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on a Vice-Admiral for indulging in nepotism by pushing for his son-in-law’s promotion while deliberately scuttling elevation of Luthra. The Vice Admiral, then serving as the Navy’s inspector-general of nuclear safety, was the senior-most reviewing officer to assess the performance of those deployed on board the nuclear submarines. “Finally justice has been given to the officer. The tribunal issued an order to accord him the rank of the Captain from the day his batch-mates were given a promotion in 2014,” Advocate Ankur Chhibber, who fought the case for Luthra, told PTI. When contacted, a Navy official said the order of the tribunal is being examined. Luthra had taken premature retirement on April 17, 2017. According to Luthra’s complaint, the Vice Admiral manipulated the system to performance appraisal system to favour his son-in-law. In May, 2018, a special promotion board constituted following an order in the case by the tribunal had also rejected Luthra’s promotion. “The applicant is entitled for empanelment for promotion and will be promoted notionally and granted the substantive rank of Captain from the original date of his batch. He will be entitled to pay accordingly till the date of retirement and thereafter to pension and all terminal benefits in his enhanced rank (Captain),” the tribunal said. It ordered the Navy to pay his dues within a period of four months. In its order, the tribunal severely criticised the Navy for arbitrarily and discriminatorily denying promotion to Luthra. “The tribunal is duty-bound not only to protest a person from being subjected to a violation of law, but to advance justice and not to thwart it,” the order by the principal bench of the tribunal said. “Clearly, arbitrariness, contrary to the policy and against the principles of natural justice, is writ large in the Special Review Board and therefore, it is liable to be set aside,” it said.',\n",

       " 'KOLKATA: Netraprasad Sharma, a Class X dropout from Pampu bustee in West Bengal’s Buxa Tiger Reserve Forest, received an international call a few days ago. He could hardly believe himself when the caller identified herself as J K Rowling, the world-renowned British author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling told Sharma, who works as a tour guide in the reserve forest zone, that she wanted to feature him as the main character in her upcoming novel. After the call, She sent Sharma a 272-page draft of the novel with a request to meet her in California to discuss the finer details about his life and work. “She helped me to get a passport and my visa application approved. I am California bound this July,’’ said Sharma. The seed of Sharma’s journey from Buxa to California was sown a year ago when a group of six US students visited the tiger reserve. They were impressed by Sharma’s knowledge of the wildlife, including his ability to track the locations of wild animals. After the tour ended, the students interviewed him for more than an hour. During the interview, recorded on camera, he narrated his plight —how he stopped pursuing higher education because of a financial crisis at home and how his love for nature made him a tour guide. “After the students left, I got busy with my profession and forgot them,’’ recounted Sharma. “A few days ago, I received a call from one of the students named Laura. She told me that J K Rowling wanted to speak. I could not believe myself. Rowling wanted to portray me in her next novel after watching the interview by students.”',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The recent Supreme Court judgment on reservations has set off a political storm in the cow belt states, especially Bihar, where Assembly elections are due this year, with leaders of pro-NDA parties and the Mahagathbandhan voicing alarm. While the Bhim Army has called for a bandh on February 23, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has announced a dharna on February 16. The SC order has also arraigned employees against various governments in states where castes have to underline the political and electoral power play. It was the Uttarakhand government, which had first challenged the provision for promotions in reservations for depressed classes claiming it could not be deemed to be a fundamental right, a stand, which was shot down by the Uttarakhand High Court. The state had then moved the apex court, which vacated the HC ruling, allowing the state to shed reservations in promotions. Post the ruling, Uttarakhand finds itself in a peculiar situation with the SC/ST employee union’s threatening a stir. The ruling has set off a political war too. Jaswant Singh Rawat, a political commentator said, “Uttarakhand will find it difficult to accommodate the demands of SC/ST and OBCs after the verdict. There will be long-term political damage if the situation is not addressed.” Karam Ram, state president of SC/ST government employees, said there are 30,000 such employees. He said the communities had less than 10% representation in all India services and its pruning by state discretion was not ideal. Union Minister for Social Justice Thawar Chand Gehlot has said that the Centre has taken cognizance of the order and appropriate steps will be taken, but that has not stopped political wars from unfolding in the states. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra blamed the Uttarakhand government for taking the review to court to deny promotions to SC/ST employees. In 2016, the Madhya Pradesh HC had quashed provisions in Public Service Promotion Rules 2002, relating to promotions to SC/ST categories on all posts, which the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government had challenged in the SC, which in turn ordered status quo. The case is now to come up in SC on February 24 and states like Bihar and Tripura are awaiting the judgment to provide pending promotions. Vijay Shankar Sharwan, the spokesperson of Janjati Adhikari Karamachari Sangh, said: “The Kamal Nath government has roped in top lawyers to represent the case in SC and the CM has said that he was in favour of such reservations to continue.” He added while the SC/ST employees’ share in the state government administration should be 34%, it was actually around 10%. The SC order has, meanwhile, sent shivers across UP’s political spectrum. The state has been the testing ground of Mandal politics since the 1990s and as expected the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party have warned of struggle against the order, should the state government implement it. The SP and BSP have charged the ruling BJP at the Centre for conniving against the backwards and Dalits. “The Union should address the situation and not keep the matter hanging,” BSP chief Mayawati said. While Akhilesh Singh called for immediate caste census to arrive at the actual figures for the depressed classes so that their share of posts and power can be allocated. The impact has been more pronounced in Rajasthan where the CM Ashok Gehlot and deputy CM Sachin Pilot called for a protest, putting the BJP on the defensive. Harish Meena, Congress MLA, advised the party to bring in a Bill in the Assembly to oppose the verdict, even as the BJP has opted for a diplomatic silence. In Bihar, where some 2.5 lakh employees, including 50,000 of SC/ST groups are awaiting promotions since 2015, the situation has turned volatile. Devendra Rajak, general secretary of SC/ST employees association said, “If the state puts promotions on hold, there will be a political storm.” LJP leader Chirag Paswan, a BJP ally, said the SC order goes against the concept of reservations and his party ‘will not agree” to it, a stand shared by the RJD and HAM(S).

Announcing the ban a UEFA statement declared: “The Adjudicatory Chamber has imposed disciplinary measures on Manchester City Football Club directing that it shall be excluded from participation in UEFA club competitions in the next two seasons (ie. the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons).” European football’s governing body said that City “failed to cooperate in the investigation”. “The adjudicatory chamber, having considered all the evidence, has found that Manchester City Football Club committed serious breaches of the UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations by overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016,” European football’s governing body said.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on a plea challenging the bail granted by the Jharkhand High Court in one of the fodder-scam cases. A bench, comprising Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant, sought response from Yadav on the plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The probe agency has challenged the July 12, 2019, order passed by the high court at Ranchi, saying it had “erroneously” suspended the sentence awarded by the trial court and released the RJD chief on bail in one of the fodder-scam cases. The high court had granted Yadav bail in the case of fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 89.27 lakh from the Deoghar treasury on the ground that he had served half of his prison term of three-and-a-half years.',\n",

       " 'Realme had planned to unveil its premium smartphone – the Realme X50 Pro 5G at the MWC 2020 event. However, with the event getting canceled due to the Coronavirus outbreak, its launch was uncertain. But, the company has now confirmed its arrival later this month. The Realme X50 Pro 5G is now scheduled to launch on February 24. Madhav Sheth, Realme India head, has confirmed the launch via an official mail and has also shared the reason for the event’s cancellation being the Coronavirus outbreak. The company has said, “Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, realme has been concerned about the effects and working on alternatives of all possible situations, including having planned our event undertaken by our European team based in Spain without any staff from China. Keeping it light with the impact of the virus and the cancellation of MWC 2020, realme has decided to cancel the participation at MWC Barcelona 2020, accordingly”. The event is being hosted online and currently, it is unknown when it will go up for sale. Also, it remains to be seen when the company will bring this handset to the Indian market and in which price bucket. The Realme X50 Pro 5G’s hardware was recently teased officially. The teaser confirmed Android 10 OS wrapped around the company’s Realme UI. The company had launched the C3 recently packed with the same UI and is expected to ship the Realme 6 also with this UI. The octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor will be the powerhouse. This chipset will have an integrated modem for 5G network connectivity. It is speculated to launch with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage configuration. Whether or not it will have storage expansion support, is currently unknown. We expect its hardware details to surface online in the coming days.',\n",
       " 'NASA has recruited four new teams to further explore the Solar System. Two of these teams will be exploring Venus, while other two will be studying Jupiter’s volcanic moon Io and work on understanding Neptune’s moon Triton. NASA is sanctioning $3 million to each of the teams to help study and observe celestial bodies. “These selected missions have the potential to transform our understanding of some of the solar system’s most active and complex worlds,” a press release by Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate notes. The idea is to unlock the secrets of how, and others like it came to be in the cosmos. NASA VERITAS One of the teams set to study Venus will work on VERITAS. It expands to Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy. The team would be mapping the surface of the planet and gathering data about the planet developed and how it became so different from our Earth. VERITAS would also map infrared emissions from the surface to map Venus’ geology, which is largely unknown. NASA DAVINCI + Here, DAVINCI+ stands for Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging Plus. This too would be heading to Venus and would primarily focus on Venus’ gases surrounding the planet. NASA would be sending a probe deep into the planet’s atmosphere, a key highlight of the mission. The objective is to understand how Venus’ atmosphere evolved and if it had an ocean before. NASA IVO As part of the new announcement, NASA is prepping a team to study Jupiter’s moon Io. IVO or Io Volcano Observer would be sent to the moon. Incidentally, Io is deemed to be the most volcanic body in the entire Solar System. The NASA IVO mission aims to get to a closer look at Io’s extreme volcanism in a bid to understand more about its structure. NASA Trident The last mission newly scheduled is Trident. It’s the only non-acronym proposal in the bunch (possibly named after Neptune, the Roman god of the sea’s weapon). NASA says the Trident would visit Triton, one of Neptune’s Moons to map its surface. The objective is to look for clues if the Moon has a predicted subsurface ocean. At the same time, NASA is gearing up for the upcoming Artemis mission to the Moon. The space agency is looking for new astronauts, whose mission would be to set up a station and eventually send humans to Mars. The next batch of NASA astronauts would require slightly different job requirements, NASA spokesperson Brandi Dean says “it’s the best job, on or off the planet.” Of course, the hiring process would be a long one. And once hired, there would be rigorous training sessions. Astronauts would require working in real life-or-death situations. They would join the current league of 48 astronauts in the active corps. After much training and classroom sessions, they would be assigned to a mission, which in turn has its own set of training.',\n",
       " 'Poha is a traditional Indian breakfast food and is still favoured in Indian households. With a variety of breakfast dishes such as oatmeal and pancakes, poha has taken a back seat. The health benefits offered by poha are plenty and when consumed, is light on your tummy – making it the perfect breakfast dish. 1. Easily Digestible Your breakfast must be the healthiest meal of the day as it is the first meal you consume to before starting your day. Let’s explore why poha is said to be the healthiest breakfast food. Poha is a light breakfast food that eases the digestive system. As poha is easy to be digested, it will not lead to bloating and help keep you feeling full for a longer period [3], making it a suitable breakfast, if you are looking for losing some weight. 2.

It contains 76.9 per cent of recommended carbohydrates and about 23 per cent of fats [4]. So, having poha for breakfast will give you the right amount of energy without storing any fat. 3. Regulates Blood Sugar Levels Poha is rich in fibre and helps control the release of sugar into the bloodstream and preventing any sudden spikes in blood sugar levels [5]. This property of poha makes it a suitable food for individuals who are suffering from diabetes [6]. 4. Rich In Iron Regular consumption of poha has been linked with the prevention of iron deficiency and thus reducing the risk of anaemia [7]. Children, as well as pregnant and lactating women, can benefit from poha when consumed as a breakfast dish. Pregnant women are at a higher risk of gestational anaemia and are often advised to eat poha [8]. For better iron absorption in the body, squeeze the juice of a lemon. 5. Low In Gluten People who are sensitive to gluten foods like wheat and barley can opt for poha because it is very low in gluten [9]. As poha is low in gluten, it can also be considered by people who have to consume low-gluten foods on doctor’s advice. 6. Low In Calories This healthy dish is low in calories. Poha contains around 76.9 per cent of recommended carbohydrates and about 23 per cent of fats, making it the perfect option for people looking forward to losing some weight in a healthy way [10]. 7.

       " 'BENGALURU:  Indian tennis players have always rued the lack of ATP tournaments in the country. With just one ATP 250 and one or two Challenger events a year, they have a point. The likes of India’s singles specialists — Prajnesh Gunneswaran, Sumit Nagal, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Saketh Myneni, and Yuki Bhambri — all have to travel elsewhere to compete. At the Bengaluru Open Challenger, Indians had won the last two editions — Nagal in 2017 and Gunneswaran in the last edition. This time, India had a better chance of making it three in a row with as many as 11 players in the singles main draw. However, all of them exited before reaching the quarterfinals. On Thursday, Gunneswaran’s 6-7 (5), 0-6 loss to Benjamin Bonzi of France in the pre-quarterfinal ended India’s challenge. Earlier, Myneni lost to ninth seed Thomas Fabbiano 4-6, 7-5, 2-6, Nagal lost to 11th seed Blaz Rola 3-6, 3-6 while Ramanathan suffered a 6-7(2), 1-6 defeat to Ilya Ivashka. National champion Niki Poonacha also exited from the third round, losing to third seed Yuichi Sugita of Japan 5-7, 3-6. For Gunneswaran especially, it was a bad day at the office. The India No 1 won just 17 per cent of his first serve and 13 per cent of the second to surrender the set 0-6. “I didn’t do anything right from the start to the end today (Thursday). It wasn’t an issue of focus. I wasn’t comfortable from the beginning and that was the case throughout the first set. Once I lost the first set, I kind of lost the match mentally,” said Gunneswaran. Paes-Ebden in semis Indian doubles players though had a good day. The pair of Purav Raja and Ramkumar Ramanathan booked a place in the semifinals while Saketh Myneni and Leander Paes won their respective matches with their Australian partners. Against the Maharashtra Open champion duo of Christopher Rungkat and Andre Goransson, Paes and Matthew Ebden were stretched to the limit. But in the end, Paes-Ebden won 7-5, 0-6, 10-7 in the super tie-break of the quarterfinals. “They were returning very well and we struggled with that a bit. But we kept coming back. In the second set, we lost three deuce points. That was where we couldn’t do more,” said Paes. Results (Indians unless specified): Singles (pre-quarters): T Fabbiano (ITA) bt S Myneni 6-4, 5-7, 6-2; I Ivashka (BLR) bt R Ramanathan 7-6 (2), 6-1; B Rola (SLO) bt S Nagal 6-3, 6-3; B Bonzi (FRA) bt P Gunneswaran 7-6 (5), 6-0; Y Sugita (JPN) bt N Poonacha (IND) 7-5, 6-3; S Travaglia (ITA) bt M Safwat (EGY) 6-2, 7-6 (5); J Duckworth (AUS) bt F Ferreira Silva (POR) 7-6 (9), 6-1; J Ocleppo (ITA) bt S Rawat 7-5, 6-4.',\n",
       " 'CHENNAI: Rarely during their tenure, did the Virat Kohli-Ravi Shastri combine make long-term plans other than getting Rohit Sharma to open at home, keeping in mind the ICC Test Championship assignments in New Zealand and Australia. They were building up for this since October, but just a week away from the first Test in Wellington, they have to plan afresh. And they have just one warm-up game to test what works. While Rohit’s calf injury has ruined Plan A, it has also opened the door for Shubman Gill, who looks certain to make his Test debut. News is, there is no guarantee that despite some heavy scoring in home conditions, Mayank Agarwal will be in the XI. The three-day fixture starting on Friday is a platform for India to choose between him and Prithvi Shaw. Agarwal, who scored a double century in India’s last Test series against Bangladesh, would have been a sure starter. But since arriving in New Zealand with the India A team in the second week of January, the opener has not touched fifty in nine innings across all formats, including the ODIs. That he collected a pair in an unofficial Test in Christchurch against New Zealand A has prompted the team management to keep options open. Though there were talks of Shaw and Agarwal being the favoured pair, Gill has made a strong case for himself with scores of 83, 204 not out and 136 in two unofficial Tests. Only the second century came as an opener, but Gill’s temperament and rich vein of form haven’t gone unnoticed. The team management has been impressed by the way he has shaped up after becoming a part of the Test squad in the series against South Africa and Bangladesh. Shaw didn’t play the first-class fixtures in New Zealand, but scored 150 in a practice match for India A. Since then, he has touched fifty only once in six innings to go with two forty-plus scores. With little to choose between Agarwal and Shaw, India will be using the tie to decide who partners Gill at the top as they are wary of New Zealand’s new-ball bowlers. If Shaw and Agarwal don’t deliver in the practice fixture, India may also think of slotting Hanuma Vihari at the top, like they did in Melbourne in 2018. He has scored two fifties and a century in three innings on this tour for India A. One of the fifties came when he opened. That India are exploring these options isn’t surprising because they are aware of what New Zealand bowlers can do in their own conditions. The seam attack of Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Neil Wagner, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson can not only make early inroads by pitching it up and bringing swing into the equation, but they also use the short ball to good effect. Wagner, especially, has become an exponent of it, which is why India’s think-tank is keen on playing in-form batsmen at the top, rather than those who did well in the past. With regards to the bowling department, India are keeping a close watch on the workload of Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah, as there are concerns over Ishant Sharma’s availability. The pacer is scheduled to undergo a fitness test on Saturday in Bengaluru. If he fails, India will play Umesh Yadav.',\n",
       " 'BENGALURU:  When top managers like Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp praise Sheffield United’s performance over the course of the season, you know the club is doing something special. They were one of the favourites to be relegated after attaining Premier League promotion, but are above Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal on the points table. With 39 points and in fifth place, they are in contention for a European slot. No one saw it coming. Such has been their rise that Sheffield manager Chris Wilder and Liverpool’s Klopp are mentioned in the same breath when talks of manager of the year arise. Opinion is divided among experts too. The Englishman has been in charge of the club since 2016, overseeing two promotions in three seasons, but this season has been something extraordinary at a shoestring budget. Wilder’s tactics and entertaining brand of football has been talked about. Their decisive pressing has made teams sweat, and the 3-5-2 formation with overlapping centre-backs has been effective. The wing-backs offer width too, making them a solid team going forward. With such style, one would assume that they would concede easily. The opposite has happened and their defensive solidity has stood out. Other than three goals by United against them in November, no team has scored more than two in any league game. They have conceded 24 goals, second best after Liverpool, and have nine clean sheets. “We’ve got a good structure in our team, from the top of the pitch to the back three and five, everybody knows their jobs defensively,” said Wilder in an email interview. “We pressed in League One and the Championship and we’re selective with our pressing now. I wouldn’t say we are 100 per cent a pressing team. It’s about the right time to press and when to keep a good shape behind the ball.” If smaller clubs are to remain in the top half of the table, competing against big teams becomes crucial. And they have done that this season to an extent. They made headlines with an impressive 1-0 win over Arsenal in October at Bramall Lane. Besides, they have secured draws against United, Tottenham and Chelsea as well. They lost to Liverpool and City, both home and away, but it was not a walk in the park for either of the two opponents. It is belief and never-say-die attitude, which has worked for the South Yorkshire club. “I don’t think it (sense of no fear) is just against the top teams. I think it’s against any team. It’s come from the way we set up, the attitude of the players, our attitude as a club and whichever team we play, we believe we can win the game, understanding that we’re playing against some top sides,” added Wilder, who wants to establish his team in the division.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday directed the managing directors and directors of telcos and other firms to explain why contempt action should not be taken against them for non-compliance of its order to pay adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of Rs 1.47 lakh crore to the Department of Telecommunications. Taking strong note of the non-compliance of its order, a bench of Justice Arun Mishra, Justice S Abdul Nazeer and Justice M R Shah expressed anguish over the order passed by DoT’s desk officer staying the effect of its verdict in AGR matter. “We don’t know who is creating this nonsense. Is there no law left in the country. It is better not to live in this country and rather leave the country,” the bench observed. “Call the desk officer here! Do you want us to wind up the Supreme Court? We will draw up contempt of court against everyone!,” LiveLaw quoted Justice Mishra as saying. The top court said a desk officer is writing a letter to the Attorney General and other constitutional authorities saying they should not insist on payment of money by telcos and others and to ensure that no coercive action is taken against them.

       " 'BAGDAD:  Hundreds of Iraqi women of all ages flooded central Baghdad on Thursday alongside male anti-government protesters, defying an order by powerful cleric Moqtada Sadr to separate the genders in the rallies. Some were veiled, others not, still more wrapped their faces in black-and-white checkered scarves. Most carried roses, Iraqi flags or signs defending their role in the regime change demonstrations. They marched through a tunnel and spilled out into Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the youth-dominated movement in a country where vast regions remain socially conservative. “We want to protect women’s role in the protests as we’re just like the men. There are efforts to kick us out of Tahrir but we’ll only come back stronger,” said Zainab Ahmad, a pharmacy student. “Some people were inciting against us a few days ago, seeking to keep women at home or keep them quiet. But we turned out today in large numbers to prove to those people that their efforts will end in failure,” she said. Ahmad appeared to be referring to controversial cleric Moqtada Sadr, a powerful figure who first backed the rallies when they erupted in October but who has since sought to discredit them. On Saturday, the militiaman-turned-politician had alleged drug and alcohol use among the protesters and said it was immoral for men and women to mix there. And a few moments before Thursday’s women’s march began, Sadr once again took to Twitter to slam the protests as being rife with “nudity, promiscuity, drunkenness, immorality, debauchery and non-believers”. In a strange turn, he said Iraq must not “turn into Chicago,” which he said was full of “moral looseness” including homosexuality, a claim that was immediately mocked online. While the numbers in Tahrir have dwindled in recent weeks, many Iraqi youth say the past four months of rallies have helped break down widespread conservative social norms. Men and women were seen holding hands in Tahrir and even camping out in the square together. On Thursday, men linked arms to form a protective ring around the women as they marched for over an hour. “Revolution is my name, male silence is the real shame!” they chanted, then adding “Freedom, revolution, feminism!” Some of their chants were snide remarks at Sadr himself. “Where are the millions?” some said, referring to the cleric’s call for a million-strong march several weeks ago that saw much smaller numbers hit the streets. The rallies have slammed Iraqi authorities for being corrupt, incompetent and beholden to neighbouring Iran. “They want us to be a second Iran, but Iraqi women weren’t born to let men dictate to them what to do,” protester Raya Assi told AFP on Thursday. “They have to accept us the way we are.”',\n",

Way to rub it in!” Passengers onboard were being offered a “Valentine’s Day” breakfast, Smith said. “We were reminded what day it was by the delivery of what the crew member said was a ‘special’ breakfast,” he said. “Not sure why hard-boiled eggs, sausage, and sauteed mushrooms are special.” The dinner menu, on the other hand, promises several special treats in honour of the day. “Cupid’s Avocado and Shrimp salad” to start, followed by “Shrimp Valentine Japanese style with rice and vegetables.” The main course is the French classic Coq au Vin with mashed potato and vegetables, and a “Valentine’s Day surprise dessert of the day” is promised. “Coq au Vin, yes please,” tweeted Yardley Wong, who has been posting her efforts to keep her young son entertained on the quarantined vessel. “A special meal for Valentine’s Day, a reserved bottle of red,” she added, with her usual hashtag #hanginthereDiamondPrincess and a picture of a bottle of wine.',\n",
       " 'SEOUL: The United States expressed deep concern about North Korea’s vulnerability to the outbreak of a new virus and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the impoverished nation. North Korea has moved to strengthen quarantines and other preventive measures to protect itself from the COVID-19 illness that has killed hundreds and sickened tens of thousands in China, North Korea’s neighbour and closest ally. North Korea has yet to report a case of the new virus, but state media have hinted that an uncertain number of people have been quarantined after showing symptoms. Experts say an epidemic in North Korea could be dire because of its chronic lack of medical supplies and poor health care infrastructure. “We strongly support and encourage the work of U.S. and international aid and health organizations to counter and contain the spread of coronavirus in the DPRK,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “The United States is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organizations.” North Korea’s media have described the fight against the illness as a matter of “national existence.” It has shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned foreign tourists, intensified screening at airports, harbors and other land entry points, and mobilized some 30,000 health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms. South Korea withdrew dozens of officials from an inter-Korean liaison office in a North Korean border town after the North insisted on closing it until the epidemic is controlled. The North this week also announced it will impose a monthlong quarantine for all foreign visitors and others suspected to have the virus. The Russian Embassy in Pyongyang previously had said North Korea had imposed a 15-day quarantine on foreign visitors. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has said its branch in North Korea has mobilized 500 volunteers in areas close to the Chinese border to assist doctors in house-to-house screening and promoting personal hygiene. Volunteers are also using hundreds of bicycles to reach North Korean households in remote areas and raise awareness of the virus, the IFRC said. “All the institutions and fields of the state and foreigners staying in the DPRK should obey it unconditionally,” the Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday about the North’s quarantine. “The spread of the epidemic comes to be a serious problem with the possibility of international disaster.” South Korea, which has reported 28 cases of the virus, said there’s a need for inter-Korean cooperation to contain the spread of the disease. Cho Hey-sil, a spokeswoman of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said Friday her government will consider public opinion before deciding whether to formally propose joint quarantine efforts with the North. North Korea has virtually suspended all cooperation and diplomatic activities with the South in past months amid a standstill in large nuclear negotiations with the United States, which have faltered over disagreements in easing U.S.-led sanctions against the North in exchange for the North’s disarmament steps.',\n",

Justice PD Naik rejected the pre-arrest bail pleas filed by them. The court, however, extended the interim protection from arrest granted to them for a period of four weeks so that they can approach the Supreme Court in appeal. Navlakha, Teltumbde and several other activists have been booked by the Pune Police for their alleged Maoist links and several other charges following the violence at Bhima Koregaon village in Pune district on January 1, 2018. According to Pune Police, “inflammatory” speeches and “provocative” statements made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017 had triggered caste violence at Koregaon Bhima the next day. The police alleged that the conclave was backed by Maoists.

Ambedkar announced the march while addressing a press conference in the capital. Other Ambedkar groups from across the country would join the march. The final point of the march would be Jantar Mantar. “Several groups would be coming from all over India to join the march. All Ambedkar groups would be joining the march.

       " 'PATNA: Early last week, the RJD created a huge flutter by decidedly opting for a larger co-option of extremely backward castes (EBCs) to counter the Nitish Kumar-led NDA’s sway over 45 per cent OBC-EBC vote base in Bihar. The move was a conscious effort by the RJD to change its image as a Muslim-Yadav combine, which founder Lalu Prasad used as the party bedrock since 1990. The RJD overhaul of 38 district units saw as many as 14 EBCs taking charge as presidents, with 11 Yadavs, 7 Muslims and Dalits for a new caste Mahagathbandhan. EBCs – an umbrella of some 100 castes and totalling 22 per cent of Bihar voters – have split almost evenly between parties, but to NDA’s advantage lately. The configuration of 22 per cent EBCs with OBC (23 per cent) formations minus Yadavs (13 per cent) have stood by NDA, though they transferred votes to the Mahagathbandhan in 2015 when Nitish joined RJD-Congress against NDA formation of the BJP, Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP and Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP. It proved that appropriate caste combinations could trump religion-based politics. However, Nitish quitting Mahagathbandhan to re-join the NDA has created a powerful phalanx of upper castes with EBC-OBCs. There is little RJD potential to split Brahmins, Rajputs, Bhumihars and Kayasthas – 80 per cent of whom vote NDA. Current a rudderless RJD with Lalu in jail, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi Yadav having little acceptance outside, and the party’s first family embroiled in IT, ED and domestic violence cases, the Mahagathbandhan of RJD, HAM, VIP, RLSP and Congress is in no shape to challenge the NDA or split the EBC-OBC vote bank. The Congress is also likely to contest alone in 2020 and could force a three-way fight, which can only bolster the NDA. The opposition can’t match Nitish’s record of piped water and power, prohibition, wiping out organised crime, 50 per cent reservation to women and EBCs in panchayats either, Post Delhi poll drubbing, the BJP has no choice but to accept Nitish as the NDA leader and unanimous CM face.',\n",

According to the BJP sources, the decision of sending a heavyweight national leader to Bengal was taken after the party’s debacle in Delhi elections. “Initially it was decided that national president JP Nadda will visit Bengal but the high-command decided to send Shah. It is because the chief minister has been opposing CAA tooth and nail and we need a leader like Shah or Modi to combat it,” said a senior BJP leader. Since last year, the demand for NRC to weed out infiltrators and the new citizenship law has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the state with the Trinamool Congress opposing them tooth and nail and the BJP pressing for their implementation. Since the CAB was passed in the Rajya Sabha in December last year, the Bengal chief minister has been hitting roads to lead protest marches and addressing rallies urging people to oppose it and not produce any document before any government officials. After BJP’s defeat in Delhi Assembly elections, poll managers of its Bengal unit are divided whether to push its aggressive strategies on the CAA-NRC or mellow it down and replace it with alternative plans of governance. While a section of leaders believes to keep up the tempo and aggressive strategy on CAA-NRC issue, another section prefers to highlight the governance issue along with the two factors. “In Bengal, we took our tally from 2 to 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats and swept all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi in 2019 general elections. But within a few months, the results are completely opposite in assembly polls in Delhi. We cannot take for granted that just because we won 18 seats in Bengal, we will also win the Bengal assembly elections in 2021. We need to change our strategy for state assembly elections. It should also lay similar stress and alternative and better governance,” said a BJP leader in Bengal. Echoing the same, the saffron camp’s ideologue and Rajya Sabha MP, Swapan Dasgupta, “Not only CAA, we need to highlight better governance issues with equal priority.”',\n",

Recently, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman promised to disburse GST dues to all States in two instalments.

Aiming Kurmi community, which comprises Mahatos and forms more than 35 per cent of total electorate, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is expecting a shift in the community’s political allegiance from the BJP. In an attempt to secure Mahatos vote-bank, the ruling party is likely to portray Chhatradhar Mahato, a popular face of Maoist-backed Lalgarh movement in Jungalmahal. “The region witnessed an impact of election results in 2014 in Jharkhand in the panchayat polls in 2018. The BJP made deep inroads in the rural polls in Trinamool’s bastion but since it failed to retain the state, it will have an impact in Jungalmahal region. The Mahatos and tribals, who had voted for the BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, are expected to shift their political allegiance and we will have to swing their mood in our favour before 2021 Assembly elections,’’ said a senior Trinamool leader. The All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU), a political outfit comprising supporters of Mahato community, has a significant influence over the kurmis in Jhargram, Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia districts. “The AJSU broke the alliance with the saffron camp in Jharkhand polls. It is a good sign for us. The change in AJSU’s political stance will have an impact in Bengal’s backward region and a major chunk of Mahato voters is expected to shift their loyalty from BJP to Trinamool Congress,” said the leader. The Bengal BJP, however, claimed they are not bothered about Jharkhand election results and break up with the AJSU. “Though we and AJSU parted ways in Jharkhand, but we maintain good relation with its president Sudesh Mahato. The Trinamool’s plan to bring Mahato votes in its favour will not work,” said a state BJP leader. The political leaders, however, admitted the electoral mood in Jungalmahal is not predictable.',\n",

The orders were passed “without application of mind” and without following due procedures, the court noted. Giving reasons for upholding the arguments of the petitioners that there was no application of mind by the Police Commissioner (Bhaskar Rao) before imposing restrictions, a division bench of the High Court said he had not recorded the reasons, except reproducing the contents of letters addressed to him by the Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs). The state government had contended that prohibitory orders were passed based on reports submitted by the DCPs who expressed apprehension about anti-social elements creating law and order problems and damaging public property by taking advantage of the anti-CAA protests. The High Court bench said the Police Commissioner should have conducted inquiry as stated by the Supreme Court to check the reasons cited by the DCPs who submitted identical reports. Except for this, there were no facts laid out by the Police Commissioner, the court said. “There is complete absence of reasons. If the order indicated that the Police Commissioner was satisfied by the apprehension of DCPs, it would have been another matter,” it said. “The apex court has held that it must record the reasons for imposition of restrictions and there has to be a formation of opinion by the district magistrate. Only then can  the extraordinary powers conferred on the district magistrate can be exercised. This procedure was not followed. Hence, exercise of power under Section 144 by the commissioner, as district magistrate, was not at all legal”, the bench said. Order not applicable in general: Court “We hold that the order dated December 18, 2019 is illegal and cannot stand judicial scrutiny in terms of the apex court’s orders in the Ramlila Maidan case and Anuradha Bhasin case,” the HC bench said while upholding the arguments of Prof Ravivarma Kumar, who appeared for some of the petitioners. Partly allowing a batch of public interest petitions questioning the imposition of prohibitory orders and cancelling the permission granted for protesters in the city, the bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar observed that, unfortunately, in the present case, there was no indication of application of mind in passing prohibitory orders. The bench said the observation was confined to this order only and it cannot be applicable in general. If there is a similar situation (necessitating imposition of restrictions), the state is not helpless, the court said. COMMISSIONER CANNOT RELY ON DG&IGP The bench said although the Police Commissioner is subordinate to the DG&IGP, he does not act on the top police officer’s opinions as he was passing the prohibitory order as District Magistrate.

India is estimated to bear losses equalling 5.4 per cent of India’s GDP annually, the third-highest cost from fossil fuel air pollution worldwide. Another source of economic costs is that approximately 3,50,000 new cases of child asthma each year are linked to NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion and as a result, around 12,85,000 more children in India live with asthma linked to fossil fuel pollution, it said. “Air pollution is a threat to our health and our economies. Every year, air pollution from fossil fuels takes millions of lives, increases our risk of stroke, lung cancer and asthma, and costs us trillions of dollars.

       " 'Andy Rubin, the co-creator of the Android had established the Essential startup. The company launched a single handset: the Essential Phone in 2017. But now, the company is stopping all software updates. Even though the smartphone didn’t catch on like its counterparts, monthly patches and Android updates kept coming. Now, the software updates and other security patches for the Essential Phone will no longer appear. The company is also pulling the plug on customer support, effective immediately. In a blog post, Essential notes that it has already rolled out the February security patch, but this would be the last update from the company’s end. “Despite our best efforts, we’ve now taken Gem as far as we can and regrettably have no clear path to deliver it to customers. Given this, we have made the difficult decision to cease operations and shutdown Essential,” the blog post reads. Looking back, there was a lot of hype around the Essential Phone, mainly for its unique titanium and ceramic chassis. Andy Rubin’s earlier tarnished record in Google added to the hype for the new phone. Back then, the smartphone rolled out in the US in 2017 and was shipped a year later as a Sprint exclusive (yet, it came out as an unlocked device). More importantly, the Essential Phone featured a unique modular system that allowed other accessories like a 360-degree camera to be magnetically attached at the back. However, the Essential’s modular plan died down slowly, but the company continued sending out software tweaks and security patches.   Back in 2017, the phone became one of the first few to present a nearly bezel-less display and ran the near-stock Android version. The phone was also known to release major new Android updates faster than other phone makers (apart from Google). Yet, the phone hardly made a sales impact and has died down today.',\n",

       " 'LUCKNOW: PM Narendra Modi’s dream project the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor — construction for which commenced on January 15, 2020 — has run into a temple hurdle. Thirteen ancient temples, housed in different residential buildings, are situated in the path of the corridor. These temples need to be temporarily relocated before commencing construction of the ambitious project. According to sources, the temples are situated on hillocks and the ground beneath has become supple and weak. As a result, the use of heavy machinery may lead to cracks in the temples. Now, the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project managers have urged the Kashi Vishwanath Management Temple Trust to relocate the temples temporarily. “We have urged the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Management to relocate the temples temporarily following Vedic rituals till the construction of the corridor,” said one of the project managers. The corridor aims to provide devotees easier access to the Kashi Vishwanath temple that houses one of the pre-eminent Shiva lingas and is thus considered among the most sacred temples. Last month, the wall of a house of an erstwhile Mahant of Kashi Vishwanath temple had collapsed under the impact of heavy machines. Work on the corridor is on in full swing as the state government has set 2021 as the deadline for its completion. Modi, who represents Varanasi in Lok Sabha, had laid the foundation stone of the project on March 8, 2019. Rejecting the charges on the reported demolition of hundreds of temples in the path of the corridor, secretary, Varanasi Development Authority and CEO Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust Vishal Singh said all temples were restored to their original forms after the cleaning of the corridor area. These temples are being restored by the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Vishisht Kshetra Vikas Parishad as part of the project. While 291 buildings were vacated and purchased by the government for the corridor, the project also witnessed the relocation of around 500 families. Singh said only 30 per cent of the area covered under the corridor will be constructed to maintain the originality of the location. The buildings, to be constructed as part of the corridor, will be a maximum of two-storey high and not taller than the Kashi Vishwanath temple.',\n",
       " 'BEIJING: The number of deaths and new cases from China’s coronavirus outbreak spiked dramatically on Thursday after authorities changed the way they count infections in a move that will likely fuel speculation that the severity of the outbreak has been under-reported. The hard-hit central province of Hubei reported 242 deaths in just one day and 14,840 new patients — by far its biggest one-day tally since the crisis erupted last month. The jump raised the death toll to 1,355 and the total number of nationwide infections to nearly 60,000 — just hours after President Xi Jinping touted “positive results” from the government’s drastic measures to contain the virus and a top Chinese expert predicted the epidemic would peak this month. Officials in Hubei said they were broadening their definition for COVID-19 cases by including people “clinically diagnosed” with the virus in the daily tally. This means officials can use lung imaging on suspected cases to diagnose the virus, rather than the standard nucleic acid tests. China has placed some 56 million in virtual quarantine in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, since late last month and restricted movements of millions more in cities far from the epicentre in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Xi chaired a meeting of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee on Wednesday after figures showed that the number of new cases had dropped for a second straight day. China has been praised by the World Health Organization (WHO) for its transparent handling of the outbreak, in contrast to the way it concealed the extent of the SARS virus. But it has faced continued scepticism among the global public, with suggestions that there may be similarities with the way it dealt with the 2002-2003 outbreak. Authorities in Hubei have been accused of concealing the gravity of the outbreak in early January because they were holding key political meetings at the time.',\n",

       " 'Dubai, February 13: Former India all-rounder Robin Singh was appointed director of cricket of the United Arab Emirates, local media reported. The 56-year-old’s appointment comes following the sacking of Dougie Brown as head coach, reports stated. The Indian takes over at a time when the UAE’s national team is trying to recover from the fixing scandal that rocked their cricket last year, leading to suspension of a few senior players, including captain Mohammed Naveed, and disbanding of the selection panel. Without a selection committee, Brown was forced to pick the teams for the series against Scotland and the United States at home last December, and against Oman and Namibia in Muscat in January, for the World Cup League Two matches. Singh, who had represented India in one Test and 136 ODIs between 1989 and 2001, has over the years made a name for himself in coaching. He was associated with the Indian Premier League’s highly successful Mumbai Indians franchise, Caribbean Premier League’s Barbados Tridents since 2013 and T10 franchises in the T10 league here. Singh, who was born in Princes Town, Trinidad, has also conducted coaching clinics in the UAE. An agile fielder and a useful batting all-rounder with an ability to hit big shots, Singh scored 2236 runs in one-day internationals at an average of 25.95 and a best of 100. He also picked up 69 wickets in the 50-over format with a best of 5/22. Singh’s predecessor Brown departed after three years at the helm.',\n",
       " 'CHENNAI: The BCCI’s newly-formed apex council will have its first meeting with all nine members in New Delhi on Sunday. Along with releasing funds for the Indian Cricketers’ Association, appointing an ombudsman and ethics officer and chalking out the Indian team’s T20I schedule for 2021, devising a revenue-share model is also expected to be part of discussions. Under the existing arrangement, 26 per cent of the BCCI’s earnings from TV rights and other channels goes to the players. The rest is divided equally among the state units. Before the structural reforms, the number of associations was 29. After the structural revamp and inclusion of new associations, this number has gone up to 36. A section of board members are of the opinion that the new entrants — mainly the states from the Northeast — should not get an equal share of the spoils. They say that infrastructure and facilities in those places are still at a nascent stage. So they should be getting less than the associations which have been running cricket for a long time. Deliberations on this are likely at the meeting of the apex council, which is the board’s highest decision-making body. “Do you think it’s alright if Mumbai and Mizoram get the same amount? There is no comparison between what the older associations spend on development or running local cricket and what the new associations would be spending. Let’s give them a smaller amount, to begin with and increase it gradually after assessing how they are doing and how much more they need,” said a former board official. Releasing the share of profits for the associations was stopped by the Supreme Court for non-compliance in October 2016. Around that time, 29 units used to get around Rs 30 crore annually. Although the BCCI is back being governed by elected officials, funds have not been released yet. By unconfirmed estimates, the annual share of each unit is expected to increase following the record IPL broadcast deal.BCCI sources following developments said that there have been informal discussions about devising a new model wherein the older units get more. “However, this is not final. Some of the members have raised this issue. But whether the share for the new states should be less or equal is a call that the apex council will take.”',\n",

Last April he suffered a heart attack during training and has not played since. His name has been linked with the RFEF presidency for some months. The Catalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo said that “it was Casillas who requested the meeting” with Lozano. Current RFEF president Luis Rubiales is in perpetual conflict with Javier Tebas, the president of the Spanish league. According to the rules, the elections should be held in the second half of the year after the Tokyo Olympics.

But at the same time, there have been incidents in which migrants have committed crimes. When we speak to accused in many cases, it was found that if employers had taken them into confidence, they would have not committed such offences.

       " 'ISTANBUL: Turkey’s president accused Russia of committing “massacres” in its support of the Syrian government on Wednesday, escalating a war of words as more Turkish reinforcements arrived on the ground. Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to strike Syrian regime forces “everywhere” if its soldiers come under renewed attack, but Russia hit back and accused the Turks of failing to “neutralise terrorists” in the northwestern province of Idlib. Turkey has shored up its positions in recent days in Idlib — the last rebel bastion in Syria — with hundreds of vehicles carrying artillery and soldiers. And a new convoy of Turkish armoured vehicles arrived Wednesday in the town of Binnish, northeast of Idlib city, in a new deployment, an AFP correspondent said. Turkish officials say they have lost 14 soldiers in the past nine days and claim to have killed scores of Syrian government troops as they try to push back forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian forces backed by Russian airstrikes have pressed ahead with an offensive to retake Idlib from rebel groups that began in December, despite a 2018 deal agreed between Turkey and Russia in Sochi. The offensive — which has retaken numerous towns and a crucial motorway — has killed hundreds of civilians and sent hundreds of thousands fleeing for safety in harsh winter conditions. Erdogan’s direct criticism of Russia is a rare move since 2015 when Turkey shot down Moscow’s fighter jet that had strayed into its airspace. The tensions over Idlib highlight the complexity of ties between the two countries, whose rivalry stretches back into their imperial pasts and has been characterised by centuries of mistrust. “The regime, backed by Russian forces and Iran-backed militants, are continuously attacking civilians, committing massacres and shedding blood,” Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling party in parliament. He said Turkey would do “whatever necessary” to push Syrian forces back behind the 12 observation posts it set up in Idlib under the Sochi deal. “I hereby declare that we will strike regime forces everywhere from now on regardless of the Sochi deal if any tiny bit of harm comes to our soldiers at observation posts or elsewhere,” he added. In return, Russia accused Turkey of failing to honour the 2018 deal, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the Turkish side “had taken upon itself an obligation to neutralise terrorist groups” in Idlib.',\n",

The bench of Justices M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha issued the notice returnable by March 19, when the writ petition from advocate S Doraisamy, also the vice-president of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK), came up on Wednesday. The petition sought to quash a circular dated January 10 of the State Council for Education, Research and Training (SCERT), which directed removal of a certain passage in a school textbook under the caption ‘Hindu Communalism, Muslim Communalism and Indian nationalism’. The passage stated that the Hindu Maha Sabha (HMS) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) took a prominent anti-Muslim stance. An RSS member P Chandrasekaran had also filed a separate writ petition in the High Court to remove that passage on the ground that it was a baseless and wrong message. The highly objectionable passage should be deleted, otherwise it would lower the image of the RSS, he had contended. And the SCERT on January 10 had issued the circular directing the removal of the passage. In his petition, Doraisamy sought to direct the School Education authorities not to remove the passage. He submitted that it was not false and was a true historical fact. The younger generation should know the past history of the land.',\n",
       " 'JAIPUR: The recent infant deaths at a government hospital in Kota triggered unruly scenes in the Rajasthan Assembly on Wednesday. Given the poor conduct of MLAs from both the Opposition and ruling party, Speaker CP Joshi expressed grave disappointment and remarked that “he feels oppressed.” The Speaker’s anguish over the conduct of the MLAs finally made Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot intervene and strive to bring some order to the House proceedings. Trouble began during the question hour when the issue of Kota infant deaths came up. The Opposition members came into the well of the House and started chanting slogans over the recent deaths of children at Kota’s JK Lon hospital. They protested when Health Minister Raghu Sharma started giving figures of infant deaths during the previous BJP government’s tenure. Soon, some Congress MLAs also waved newspaper clippings, showing the “failure” of former health minister Rajendra Rathore who is now the Deputy Leader of Opposition in the Assembly. As the Speaker called the next question, Congress MLA from Neem-ka-Thana Suresh Modi went over to the opposition benches with a clipping, which was snatched and torn by BJP MLA Vasudev Devnani. Opposition MLAs then stormed into the well of the House and began shouting slogans. BJP member Ashok Lahoti took pieces of the torn clipping and threw them towards the treasury benches. They only returned to their seats when the question hour ended. Leader of the Opposition Gulabchand Kataria raised the issue again and asserted that the way a Congress MLA came threateningly close to an opposition MLA in the well of the house, it could someday lead to more unpleasant developments which may ruin the Assembly’s reputation. Speaker C P Joshi soon expressed his sharp disappointment over the conduct of the MLAs. However, when the Speaker criticised the Congress MLA for walking up to the opposition benches, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said the BJP members should also be told that tearing the paper was not desirable. Speaker Joshi then said that he felt pained by the behaviour of both sides and remarked: ‘‘I neither try to oppress the ruling party members nor Opposition MLAs. Instead, it is I who feel oppressed.’’ Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was finally compelled to intervene in the heated proceedings and asserted that it was unfortunate that the Speaker had to share his anguish over the conduct of the MLAs. He said disagreement by opposition MLAs was welcome but the decorum and sanctity of the House should be maintained by everyone. He also assured cooperation in running the House. This is not the first time that Speaker Joshi has made public his disappointment at the unruly behaviour of MLAs inside the House. But given his grave remarks, it is hoped that MLAs in the Rajasthan Assembly will be inspired to improve their conduct in future.',\n",

       " 'LONDON: Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya appeared before the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Wednesday for day two of his High Court appeal against being extradited to India, during which the prosecution highlighted “overwhelming evidence of dishonesty” on the part of the former Kingfisher Airlines boss. Mallya, 64, is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged Rs 9,000 crores in unpaid bank loans. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing in court on behalf of the Indian government, began countering the defence claims that there is no prima facie case against Mallya. “There is enough in the 32,000 pages of overall evidence to fulfil the [extradition] treaty obligations that there is a case to answer”, CPS barrister Mark Summers told the court as he began his submissions, which will conclude on Thursday. Mallya sat in the public gallery as his legal team highlighted the widespread woes of the airline industry in India, including another collapsed firm Jet Airways. “Let’s hear the arguments in court,” he said, as he entered the courtroom. Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench hearing the appeal, confirmed at the start that they would not be handing down their verdict immediately after the hearing, scheduled until Thursday. At the start of day two of the appeal, Mallya’s barrister, Clare Montgomery, reiterated the central defence that there had been no misrepresentation or fraud on the part of her client and that Kingfisher Airlines was the victim of economic misfortune alongside other airlines. “The airline industry is littered with examples of struggling airlines being supported for strategic reasons,” said Montgomery. She has focussed her arguments on trying to establish ‘multiple errors’ in Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot’s verdict in favour of her client’s extradition in December 2018 and revisited a series of bank statements and balance sheets provided to Indian banks to seek loans as proof of full disclosure. “There is not just a prima facie case but the overwhelming evidence of dishonesty and given the volume and depth of evidence the District Judge [Arbuthnot] had before her, the judgment is comprehensive and detailed with the odd error but nothing that impacts the prima facie case,” said Summers, who challenged the defence arguments over misrepresentation to the banks. Justice Irwin repeated Montgomery’s previous assertion of this being a ‘very dense case’ and has sought a detailed chronology and list of documents from the defence team by Monday, before they consider their verdict. On Tuesday, Montgomery had opened her arguments to try and establish that Mallya had no fraudulent intentions when he sought bank loans for his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines because he is no ‘fly by night figure but an immensely wealthy man’ who was not running any sort of ‘ponzi scheme’ but a reputable airline, which fell into economic misfortune along with other Indian airlines. “She [Arbuthnot] did not look at all of the evidence because if she had, she would not have fallen into the multiple errors that permeate her judgment,” she said. Representatives from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as well as the Indian High Commission in London were present in court for the hearing. Mallya had received permission to appeal against his extradition order signed off by former UK home secretary Sajid Javid last February only on one ground, which challenges the Indian government’s prima facie case against him of fraudulent intentions in acquiring bank loans. At the end of a year-long extradition trial at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in December 2018, Judge Arbuthnot had found ‘clear evidence of dispersal and misapplication of the loan funds’ and accepted a prima facie case of fraud and a conspiracy to launder money against Mallya, as presented by the CPS on behalf of the Indian government. Mallya remains on bail since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017 involving a bond worth 650,000 pounds and other restrictions on his travel while he contests that ruling.',\n",

The remarks of Khanderao Kand, director of non-profit organisation Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS), came in the wake of widespread protests held across India against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The CAA should have been named as Neighbour Persecuted Religious Minority Refugee Act, Kand said during a panel discussion on the amended citizenship law and abrogation of article 370 in a Virginia suburb of Washington DC on Tuesday. Branding the CAA as a refugee act would have established a right perception difficult to challenge for its opponent, he said, adding that this name would have been appropriate as it gives citizenship to the refugees and does not take away anyone’s citizenship. India-born Nissim Reuben, who is an assistant director of the American Jewish Committee’s (AJC) Asia Pacific Institute, mentioned that India is right on actions but short on building right perception, emphasising on the need of India and Indian diaspora to engage in public awareness campaigns. Political analyst Sant Gupta, at the event organized by FIIDS — a policy, advocacy and awareness forum for India and Indian diaspora-related issues — said the Indian diaspora needs to be actively engaged in political activism. India-born policy analyst and a founding member and former president of Indo-American Kashmir Forum Dr Vijay Sazawal said that the constitutional provision, under which Kashmir trifurcation was done, has been used by the Government of India in the past and hence there is a precedent that will stand in any judicial scrutiny. A Gilgit-Baltistan activist Senge Sering mentioned that India not only has a legitimate right on the region but also should protect the region from being exploited by China under the multi-billion dollars China Pakistan Economic Corridor which is part of its world empire building vision of One Belt One Border initiative.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said that in a bid to boost exports, the Central government has taken several steps including a tax refund scheme and enhanced credit to exporters. In her reply during a budget-related debate in Rajya Sabha, Sitharaman also said that the pending Goods and Services Tax compensation to states will be paid in two installments. Listing specific steps taken to improve India’s exports, the finance minister said that the existing Merchandise from India Scheme (MEIS) will be replaced with the Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) scheme, as MEIS was widely deemed as non-compliant with global trade rules. “I am making it plain that RoDTEP, which is now coming in, will adequately compensate and incentivise exporters… more than all the existing schemes put together,” Sitharaman said. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) had on Monday complained that Rs 6,000 crore worth of refunds for apparel and made-ups exporters have been blocked under MEIS and the RoSCTL (Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies) scheme. The exporters have not received any refunds between March 7 and August 1, 2019 , due to which they are facing an “acute” liquidity problem, it said.To add to the trouble, the exporters had complained, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade is now demanding the refund of MEIS paid between March 7 and July 31 last year. “This is not only unfair but also legally untenable because the policy, once announced, cannot be changed retrospectively,” FIEO said in a statement, asking the Centre to intervene in the issue as most exporters are on the verge of closure and defaults. Sitharaman on Tuesday assured that concerns raised over withdrawal of MEIS are being addressed. She also said that in order to boost credit to export sectors, the Reserve Bank of India has enhanced the sanctioned limit to the eligible under priority lending norms. “The limit has been raised from Rs 25 crore to Rs 40 crore per borrower. Furthermore, the existing criterion of units having a turnover of up to Rs 100 crore has been totally removed. So, it is applicable to anybody who wants to approach and take this priority sector lending,” she said.

It added that extended factory shutdowns in China and containment measures in Asia Pacific countries have hampered manufacturing and logistics sectors and the current production slowdown will create a backlog of orders resulting in deferred growth of trade activity, once the situation improves. “We expect these factors will reduce container throughput growth, especially at Chinese ports such as Shanghai International Port (Group) Co Ltd, and transshipment hubs such as PSA Corporation Limited,” it said. Some of the shipping firms like AP Moller-Maersk A/S and CMA CGM SA have already announced blank sailings, reflecting weakened output from China and low global trade activity because of the outbreak. According to Moody’s, due to production stoppages at bulk cargo handling ports in China, energy demand in the country may decline, leading to associated bulk shipments such as iron ore, oil, liquefied natural gas and coal, taking a hit along. That said, rated Indian ports handling bulk commodities were unlikely to be affected as they handle negligible volumes linked to China. Meanwhile, the virus outbreak could also reduce cruise activity following the quarantine of cruise ships in Hong Kong and Japan. “That said, the potential reduction of revenue and cash flow from cruises had limited impact on our rated port companies because their exposure to the cruise segment is small,” it said. India Ratings too flag concerns on virus impact New Delhi: While Indian companies are unlikely to be materially affected in near term if the coronavirus outbreak remains contained in Hubei province, India Ratings said. But if it spreads over the next 3-4 months, sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles and automobiles could face supply disruptions for critical raw materials, it observed.',\n",

I could play about five T20s in that space.” He said that in Test cricket he had prided himself on being able to bowl at high pace throughout a long day. The requirements for T20 cricket were different, “but guys need to know that it’s still there and that you can bowl a 90 miles an hour bouncer or yorker.”',\n",

According to experts, the election result is a sign that the people vote for assembly elections on local issues and differently in national elections. The difference was starkly visible in the 2020 Assembly polls. According to vote share data, the BJP, based on its 2019 Lok Sabha performance, was ahead in 65 of the 70 seats with the Congress ahead in the remaining five. “The result today, if anything was to be based on the Lok Sabha polls, should have been a tighter contest. But it was nothing like that. The AAP campaigning on local issues and BJP harping on nationalism and Shaheen Bagh worked in Kejriwal’s favour,” a political researcher from Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) said. According to data, the BJP’s vote share in almost all of the 70 segments was close to 55 per cent. In 2020, the overall vote share hovered just below 40 per cent.  “In the previous elections, when there was an AAP wave, the BJP did not fare very bad. It had close to 33 per cent vote share but it could not translate into seats. Even this time the difference between the vote shares of AAP and BJP was not greatly different. The AAP, in terms of vote share, came third in the Lok Sabha elections,” a researcher at the PRS said.',\n",
