       "['Sporting a desktop graphics Intel Core i9-9900K coupled with an RTX 2080, the MSI GT76 TITAN 9SG has the same configuration as the Alienware Area-51m. Both machines use massive power bricks which when plugged in trigger an automatic factory overclock of 32-33% for the processors. Even the graphics cards are the same RTX 2080 but MSI has a slightly higher base clock of 1575 MHz whereas the Alienware unit has that set to 1515 MHz. Boost clocks are also different with the MSI unit clocked at 1755 MHz and the Alienware at 1720 MHz. So performance wise, these two are nearly similar until you consider the next two important things in a computer, the RAM and the SSD boot drives. MSI’s gaming laptop has RAM clocked at 2666 MHz and uses two NVMe SSDs in RAID 0 for the boot drive.',\n",
       " 'The Alienware Area-51m was certainly the first of its kind to have the desktop grade Intel Core i9-9900K coupled with NVIDIA’s RTX 2080. However, as time goes by competitors brought similar configurations with slightly improved features. When powered on, the Area-51m automatically sets the processor to a 32% overclock which helps out with some video games and a lot more in high-compute tasks. The built-in Control Centre has made it even simpler to push the processor clocks higher should you need it.',\n",

The company offers the choice of high refresh rate displays going up to 144Hz and also GPU options going up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q. You also get a significantly improved thermals management system that actually manages to keep the laptop super cool even under heavy loads.',\n",

Powered by the AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors going all the way up to Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, the AMD Zephyrus G14 is a perfect laptop for those kind of people who like to game and create, but put a priority on doing so using a light-weight machine.',\n",

The display is an IPS pane with a 144Hz refresh rate, but the real highlight of the Legion Y540, besides its performance, is its stealth looks that allows the laptop to blend into an office environment as easily as it would into a LAN party.',\n",

The Pantone validated 144Hz display is great right out of the box. the keyboard will take plenty of getting used to, but the trackpad is definitely a strong point. All this aside, the GX531 is also a pretty great gaming machine.',\n",

The GT83VR 7RE Titan SLI packs two GTX 1070 GPUs in SLI along with the Intel Core i7 7820HK. It also has a massive 18.4-inch IPS display and 32 GB of RAM. Performance wise it isn't that far behind since games can hardly make use of all the firepower it has, but synthetic benchmarks put it way behind the two flagships mentioned here.\",\n",

So, you can leave behind all your concerns around the CPU bottlenecking the overall performance during gaming. With an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q, this laptop can manage pretty much anything game you throw at it and then some more. The star of the show however is the awesome 300Hz refresh rate capable, 1080p IPS panel on this gaming laptop.
