Cons wise if we see HD+ display only, no battery percentage indicator as in older iPhone 8. No assistive touch control button in it No oleophobic coating on back panel glass and finger prints are visible but since I bought mint green colour I felt lucky as it won’t be visible.',\n",
       " \"Reviewing again after 5 months. At the beginning the battery and performance was good but it degraded soon. Also I was facing heating issues. The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the brightness. Cameras are the only saving grace. But for this cost it's not worth it. Finally not good for playing games like PubG.\",\n",
       " 'Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.  P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black',\n",

       " 'As usual a great product from Apple. but the look wise there were some scope to make it more attractive. from the back it looks nice. picture quality is awesome . face id is blazing fast. The lightning fast bionic processor makes the phone butter smooth.Battery back up is unbeatable and best of the released iPhone.full display is still missing. however, a iPhone is a iPhone. The iPhone lovers know the value of an iPhone 🙂',\n",
       " \"i was confused between 11 and 11 pro. i was going towards 11 pro, but the screen size was not enough for me. And i saw 11 in the showroom. i didn't find much difference in screen quality.And cameras seems to be ok with me. And i saw offer's in flipkart and made the purchase. the device is fabulous. The hardware and software quality is excellent. The new iOS is something you need to experience yourself. The drawback i found was absence of fast charger, but the pricing can compensate that. Am using Mi fast charger and things are smooth. if you are more focused to an iPhone than a show off device, this is the best iphone you should purchase.\",\n",
       " 'Great iphone. I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. Camera is excellent, especially the nightmode Display perfect Battery backup awesome Sound quality very good Overall Apple gives you a perfect iphone in this range. Really in love with iPhone 11',\n",
       " 'Superfast delivery by Flipkart. Thanks.  1. iPhone 11 is a pretty solid phone for the money you are paying. 2. All the bad reviews about the display is confusing. It’s not that bad. 3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display. Gets adequately bright and I could not find any pixelation. 4. Performance is one of the best, if not best, in any any phone in 2019. 5. Nice cameras, solid battery life.  If you are looking for a phone in this budget, it’s the best bet for most of the people.',\n",
       " 'I really liked the budget iPhone. First I thought display would be issue as it is a LCD with less pixels, then after using my perception changed and I never felt like I am using an outdated display. Though I also use S 10+ with Amoled display.  So this is perfect iPhone and a real value for money.',\n",
       " 'Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.',\n",
       " 'I’d like to start by saying that the overall experience with the iPhone 11 is super smooth and amazing in every aspect. It’s an absolute powerhouse.  Performance - The Apple A13 Bionic is super optimised. You will not face any performance issue at all. You will never have to worry about the lag on this one.  Battery - Battery life is one of the best you can get in a iPhone at this time. It’s better than the XR. Average use can get you more than a day and heavy use will get you through the day. Although I would suggest you to buy an 12W Apple charger (iPad technically). It won’t heat your iPhone much as the 18W and will get the job done.  Camera - Camera is top notch. The wide angle and night mode are amazing to click photos and they give an artistic touch to your photos. Although the front camera has a slight smoothing feature which is basically due to smart HDR that smoothens your pictures like some beauty plus application. But still the camera is amazing and one of the best in market right now.  Display - Display isn’t bad at all. Do not believe what they say go and see for yourselves. I know it’s a 820p display but if you’re coming from an OLED you will notice the difference otherwise it works fine for most of the people. You will get used to it after a few weeks and the vessels aren’t that noticeable too. Overall display is good.  Storage - I’d recommend going for the 128GB variant as the iPhone 11 is capable of capturing in 4K 60fps you’ll run out soon if you click or shoot videos regularly. 128Gb is the sweet spot for all.  Colour - Purple and Green are my favourites. I personally dig the green which is technically teal so I bought the green 128gb variant. The iPhone 11s red is not similar to XRs red. The 11s red is lighter compared to XR.  Overall - If you’re thinking to buy an iPhone I’d suggest you go for this one instead of the Pro version as the price isn’t worth it when the iPhone 11 version is getting the job done. Pro isn’t worth the money. You can keep this phone for coming 3-4 years with you considering the updates and performance.',\n",
       " 'Can’t beat the software and hardware integration of apple. Performs like a beast. Great quality camera 6-7 hours screen on time which is good. Nothing much to complaint about the screen. Good connectivity speeds. Great buy and Flipkart’s delivery top notch as usual',\n",
       " 'I will just say its an awesome phone. Starting from speed , battery life, resolutions, camera quality, features it is superior in all department versus its predecessor. Also would like to state that at this price point it is an extraordinary value product. Recommend anyone who is looking for a highend smart phone within a range of 60k to 100K. .',\n",
       " 'I was torn between the oneplus 8 pro and the iphone 11. I had to shell out extra money for this, but I say if you can afford it, this truely is the best package. Mind blowing camera, battery and overall performance. Face Id works like magic even in complete darkness without firing up the screen brightness. The phones with in display fingerprint scanners do this at night time and it really burns your eyes. I wanted the oneplus for its display but tbh the OLEDs on oneplus is really bad. Flickering and tint issues are really irritating. It doesn’t matter if its LCD, this display works like a charm. Especially if you use it at late night the screen is kind to your eyes. Many OLEDs have this issue, thats a downside no one talks about. I say go for it. You will not regret it. Cheers🤜🏻🤛🏻',\n",

       " \"If I consider it just as a smartphone, it's pretty expensive. Have to admit that I payed a lot of money just for the brand. I understand people use apple products for years and if we consider the time span the phone is also worth for the money. But, there are also phones available under 10k and runs for years. Yes, it is true. Buy, this phone only if you want to show others how much you earn, otherwise it's nothing but just a smartphone like others are.\",\n",
       " \"It is iPhone. There isn't much I could say about the phone that isn't out there already. If you get a good deal including discount or offer on any card, just go for it. Only one major drawback, it comes with 5V basic charging which is a big let down.  From Flipkart POV, the delivery was on time, the product was in proper condition so there is no reason for anything less than 5 star.\",\n",
       " \"It's a great phone. From camera to display everything is best for the price. Best camera , best performance. I think everyone should buy it . This phone has best battery life so far in iphone series which I had used earlier. Happy to have it. Thanks Flipkart\",\n",
       " 'Iphone is best ever but Flipkart delivered is quality on the product is so promising i really satisfied and trust with it by Flipkart assured Tq..🥰',\n",
       " 'I have been using android from last 9 years and this is my first iPhone and they are good camera multitasking games even display is great though an lcd panel but colours are rich and vibrant.  One liner - A premium device with all features. 🙂',\n",
       " 'Works seamlessly, I get an avg 1.5 days battery life with moderate usage. Can’t really notice the low resolution LCD of this phone until you compare it with an AMOLed screen. Usually heats up 10 to 30% when doing high intensive tasks. Camera is no doubt at par with the flagship phones with good low light captures compared to iPhone 8. Overall iPhone 11 is better choice unless you want top notch camera and screen.']"
