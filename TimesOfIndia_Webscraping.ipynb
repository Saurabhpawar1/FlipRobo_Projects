       "['What makes an IIT Bombay alumnus change tracks and turn to films? For Ram Vamsi Krishna, it was the search for freedom. Ram debuts as a story, screenplay and dialogue writer in the multi-lingual Bhairava Geetha, which is slated to release next week. While he has written the Telugu dialogues, Maasthi has written the Kannada ones.  “I always wanted to break free and thought that academics was the way to do that. When I was in IIT, I interacted with a lot of creative people, and with time, I realised that it was writing that set me free,” says Ram. But his entry into the film industry wasn’t all that smooth. Owing to some financial issues, Ram, who lives in Hyderabad, moved to Bengaluru for three years, to work at an MNC. But he continued writing. “I followed Kannada cinema during my time in Bengaluru, which is why it was easy for me to connect with Dhananjaya (the lead actor of the film). I eventually got to meet Ram Gopal Varma. Bhairava Geetha is based on a true story, which RGV narrated to me, telling me that it is a great line to develop into a screenplay. And that’s how we started off. RGV and I developed the script and screenplay together,” says Ram.   Considering that the film is set against a rural backdrop, will urban audiences be able to relate to the film? “It has a universal subject; it is about the struggle between the powerful and the powerless. When I worked in an MNC, most of my colleagues were powerless when it came to their bosses. Some wanted to rebel, but couldn’t due to the circumstances they were in. So, there is power struggle everywhere. People in urban areas will be able to connect with the story, because everyone is suppressed at some point in their lives. Also, Bhairava Geetha is a love story, and love is a universal emotion. The movie is intense and gripping, and connects to core human emotions,” Ram signs off.',\n",
       " 'Want the latest buzz on the gossip front? A peep into the lives of the rich and famous? A wind of Chennai’s best-kept secrets? Writer, activist, anchor, and queen bee Apsara Reddy fills you in with all that and then some in this column. BIRYANI BONDS Actor Vikram is a regular at a popular ECR salon and spa. Introduced by his wife to the salon, he makes a quiet entry and enjoys his haircut, I am told. The staff say, “He is the best client and makes no fuss”. And guess what, his wife Shailaja made a pot of biryani for her favourite staff member here, as a Thanksgiving gesture, recently. This caught the staff member, who had casually mentioned to her that she loves biryani, by total surprise.   STUD OR SILLY DUD? Intentional ignorance’ is the new word in the Page 3 circles. At least, if we had to go by the conduct of a well-known gent, who has become famous by flaunting his wealth and dating much-younger women whom he later discards as ‘desperate-for-money’. This oncemarried man goes out looking for young women to prey on. Offering to take them overseas for holidays or sorting out their financial issues, he befriends them via friends or at nightclubs. Later, after having used them for his own pleasures and passions of being seen to wine and dine pretty women, he ignores them. Intentional ignorance is what his own best friend has called this behaviour. Spots his prey, lures them in, discards them and later intentionally turns up at their favourite haunts with another chick on his arms, ignoring the ex!  ON A RIDE What is celebrated racer Alisha Abdullah gearing up for? The lady is going places with her film and racing career. She has been training some super-talented women from across India to become racers and has even done a video with a prominent model and actress to promote her sport. Aside from this, she has been offered a whopping sum of money to do a film as the main lead essaying her own life story as a glorious woman racer. Her expertise on bikes and cars has landed her a plum endorsement deal with a rugged car brand, too!

Often spotted in couture and classy company, the modelturned-homemaker along with her super-successful husband, who once customised a Rajinikanth guitar, also help those in need, we’ve heard. Aru, especially, makes it a point to tally her husband’s accounts each year and donates a good chunk of the profits to charity. Her favourite pastime is to search for luxury spa holidays and also identify unique social causes where she can make a difference.

       " \"While his popularity in the playback music side have won him many a fan, but Sid Sriram is a classical music by heart. Having performed during the Margazhi season, Sid is excited about this year’s season as he starts off by performing first for The Times Thyagaraja Awards, on December 2. Excerpts from the interview: How does it feel to be a part of Times Thyagaraja? It feels good. I have always seen the advertisements in the past. Even though I haven't attended the concerts, I have heard a lot about it. I love what it stands for, and the competitions, too, are great. I am excited to be a part of it this time. As far as my performance is concerned, it will be a traditional Carnatic concert. But I will play along with the structure of the concert. I will step away from how I normally structure the concert, by starting with a little bit of a longer piece. I am excited about showcasing how dynamic of an art form Carnatic music is. I think Carnatic music is an accessible and dynamic music form that reaches many people. I will be covering different composers and highlight what I love about this classical form.  We have heard so much about your parents taking you to various festivals in the US, including the Cleveland Thyagaraja Festival, when you were young. Having started very young to now have reached this stage, are they happy today? I was born in 1990 and my mother started Carnatic vocals tuition in 1992. From 1993, both my father and mother realised that I had an inclination for music. And they started cultivating and I began learning from my mother at that time. She is my guru and I must thank my father for guiding me. I really have a strong unit. More than anything else, just the fact that music was around me all the time at home meant a lot. It allowed me to immerse myself in Carnatic music and be engaged with it. Both my parents are happy about how I've progressed, but we all know that this is just a beginning. There is a still a lot more to be explored. My mother always tells me that music is larger, larger than anything else. So, there is a lot more for me to learn. It's always a dicey situation for a musician to be in both - film and classical. And one always has the risk of not taking one of it as a full-time. Do you have that discomfort? No. Now, I have a third component as well, which is my original music and songwriting. I feed off from all three streams that I am involved in and they feed into each other. Carnatic music is my foundation and it is has always given me my creative musical framework. I used this framework to approach all my other creative endeavors. Carnatic music is an intricate, complex form and it is defined by the parameters it has set. So, it really forces the Carnatic musician to learn how to operate and be creative within these parameters. And me being present in all the different spaces that I am involved in is a true blessing. Having this experience and being immersed in different streams enhances everything I do. Each of me in playback, original and Carnatic music pushes me into doing better in every field. So, it is overwhelmingly positive.  When you aspired to be a full-time musician, there were probably 15 sabhas and 50 artistes. Today there are 100 sabhas and 500 artistes. What do you think is the key to be in the top 10 or in the much sought-after lot of artistes? One is not thinking about it as a competition, but think about it as a personal journey. For me, back when I used to think I need to be at the top of the game, nothing really worked it. I started working on my craft, worked on practicing every day, and really worked on finding my own voice and vision musically. Find your personal statement and breathe your own identity in it. Use that statement to make a deep connect with the audience. The minute you start thinking about being on the top, it will take away the magic out of the music. If a musician is feeling that spark, then everything else ends up working out for you. Work on being an individual, strengths and perform from a genuine space. Do that consistently and take note of your self-progression. I am sure you will feel happy.   An artiste usually encounters a lot of old rasikas, who are used to the traditional format. But you seem to have attracted a lot of young audience for your concerts. Do you plan your concerts in such a way that both age groups are happy?  Not so much. It is always a traditional concert for me. I plan it in such a way that I am telling a story. There is an arch in the concert, from start to finish, where it feels like bringing the listener along on a journey. Rasikas who are used to listening to Carnatic music are on a visceral level react to the same things. They want to be engaged and be part of the journey. I want my concerts to engage, be inclusive and create a circle of energy. When you do that, some of the concerts really do feel like it has been transcended. I don't really differentiate between the old and young. You can't really force anything on anyone, but what you can do is make your statement as authentic as possible. I've sung very traditional pieces and it connects across age groups. If your intention is to communicate, it will connect no matter what. I am honoured and excited that I have a lot of newer listeners to concerts. Like I mentioned before, Carnatic music is a dynamic and accessible art form. I consider myself an ambassador for the music form.   Do you think your popularity as a playback singer has also got you the crowd for classical music? Yes, of course. My work in the playback side has afforded me a great fan base. Beyond that, I have taken it upon myself to present this music in the best way possible.\",\n",
       " 'Harbouring dreams of making it in showbiz may not always be enough to make the cut. Not only did debutante Rajani Bharadwaj manage that, but she’s also done it with a team that went out of the way to make her debut happen.  “I am from Mysuru and have always dreamt of seeing myself on the big screen. I had no idea how to go about it, though, and my father was dead against the idea. He was okay with me doing ad shoots and short films, as long as it was in and around Mysuru and did not interfere with my academic schedule. My mother, though, was very supportive and if I have made it to my first film now, it is all because of her,” says Rajani, who will debut with SD Arvinda’s Mataash.   The role, she says, came to her after she attended an audition. “A few days after the audition, we had workshops, but there was no clarity on when we would actually go on floors. I was all set to go on a quick trip with my parents for their wedding anniversary, when Arvind sir said that he was starting the shoot. I was in a fix, because all our tickets and accommodation had been booked, and I could not cancel at that moment. I thought I was going to miss out on the film, but Arvind sir was more than understanding and moved the schedule around to ensure that I could finish my trip and join the team,” she says.  As Inchara in Mataash, Rajani joins Aishwarya Shindogi as the girls from Bengaluru, whose characters end up meeting the rest of the cast in Mysuru and Vijayapura, as the narrative proceeds. And what excites her the most is that her role has a lot of comedy to it. “Making someone laugh is the toughest job and I have that in Mataash,” says Rajani, for whom the film offered a springboard into Sandalwood. “I am already working on my second film, Amara Chitra Katha, under music legend Hamsalekha’s banner. From having no filmi connections to debuting soon, Mataash has helped me come a long way,” she signs off.',\n",
       " 'Priya Mani is quite the busy bee these days, literally living out of a suitcase, as she jets between Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kochi and Dubai, among other cities. She, of course, has no complaints and is happy with the variety in the work she has on hand. Apart from the dance shows she is judging on TV, her commitments to the Kannada film Nanna Prakaara and a new Telugu horror-thriller project that she has just begun, Priya is scheduled to join the team of the new Kannada sci-fi thriller Dr 56, in which she plays a pivotal role. “I am a CBI officer in the film, who investigates a spate of murders. The team, led by debutant director Raji Ananda Leela, is rather new, but I liked the concept. I will join the set by the second week of December,” says Priya. This will, incidentally, be Priya’s second tryst as a CBI officer, which could just be her first onscreen. “I played a CBI officer in RP Patnaik’s film long ago, but I have no idea about its status. In Dr 56, we are taking a casual approach, as far as my look is concerned,” she signs off.',\n",
       " \"Cinemawalas react... We have a lounge at our theatre that mothers can use in case they want space to feed their babies. There are instances when a child gets cranky during a film. So, we give parents access to our lounge to help them make their child comfortable. Not all moviegoers would know about this facility. So, after the incident that took place at a multiplex recently, we are putting up a notice all over the theatre to inform people that if any mother needs any kind of support for her infant, they should contact our manager for help. — Sunit Singh owner, Paradise Cinema The incident that took place at a city mall and its multiplex is inhuman. It is a must for all malls and theatres — be it single screens or multiplexes — to have nursing rooms. I think having a nursing room on the premises should be made mandatory just like obtaining a fire licence is. Severe action should be taken against establishments that don't comply. We, at EIMPA, will also look into the matter. We can have dedicated rooms to smoke, which is injurious to health, but no room for mothers to feed their babies? It is absolutely necessary to have a nursing room with at least four to five seats. Rest rooms can't be a place for mothers to feed their children as it's unhygienic. — Krishna Daga, president, EIMPA Many single screens of the city are quite old. It might get difficult to make structural alterations there. When it comes to multiplexes, they are new structures. Considering their ticket prices, they should think of this amenity too. Earlier on, there were no ramps for the physically challenged. Now, they have to be there. I think, we all need to be sensitive to these needs. An apology or a regret statement should have been issued by the multiplex authority after this incident. Whenever Priya opens, we will make space for feeding rooms. We have enough space for that. — Arijit Dutta, owner, Priya “We are sensitive to our guest’s needs and continuously enhance our services basis their feedback. We understand what Abhilasha Paul had to experience and we take this feedback to better our services further” — INOX spokesperson We don’t have any dedicated space in our theatre for mothers to feed their children. But the recent incident that happened at a mall is making us re-think. Some portions of our theatre are undergoing renovation. Apart from me, there are four other owners of this hall and next week we all will discuss about creating a private space for mothers and their babies. The management will soon come up with a solution, as this is a very important issue. New moms also have a social life. Not every family has someone back home to take care of their child, so that doesn’t mean they will not go out to watch a film or to shop. We should have provisions to make everyone comfortable at our theatre, specially women and elderly people. — Sourav Bose, co-owner, Basusree Cinema What happened with Abhilasha (Paul) Das Adhikari is extremely sad. Now a mother has to beg and plead for a place to feed her infant? This is something unpardonable in any civil society. Not having a nursing room in a theatre — single screen or multiplex — or at a mall is indeed a big problem that needs to be urgently addressed. I would like to call it an activity room rather than a nursing room. Apart from a canteen and washroom, a 4x6-ft or 4x4-ft space must be available in every theatre where mothers can feed their children, change their nappies etc. The same room should be accessible to women who might want to change into a different set of clothes post the movie. Washrooms are not a hygienic place to carry out such tasks. Even people who feel sick during a movie can choose to rest in this activity room. We are discussing this matter and will take action as soon as possible. — Shrikant Mohta, owner, SVF Cinemas Our theatre is in an old building. So, we have no dedicated room for nursing infants. We will need due permission for doing anything of that sort. What happened with Abhilasha (Paul) Das Adhikari was uncalled for. But it’s not that such incidents take place every day. If a lady wants to feed her baby, we are there to give her the privacy and comfort by letting her use a closed room. The manager or for that matter, even I have a room. In any such emergency, we are there to extend our help. More than dedicated rooms, what we need is a big heart to ensure our patrons are comfortable. The staff and manager should be adequately briefed to handle such situations. In our theatre, it is clearly mentioned that customers should contact the hall manager in case of any emergency. They are well trained to deal with such sensitive issues. — Navin Choukhani, owner, Navina Cinema We don’t have a dedicated room for mothers to feed their children. But what we have is humanity and a soul to understand the needs of our patrons. If any elderly person needs assistance, our staff is always there to help. Just a few days back, Dev’s bouncers needed a place to change and I had offered my room to them. Nirdharitoh jaiga noy manobikota dorkar manusher (not dedicated spaces, what we need is humanity)! If a woman ever needs a private space, whether to feed her child or for any other reason, I and my manager will be ready to leave our rooms to provide them privacy and comfort. —Dipen Mitra, owner, Mitra Cinema The recent incident is very unfortunate. Where are we all heading to? If a lady comes to our theatre to use the washroom without a movie ticket, we will surely allow her. And in this case, it was an infant’s mother who needed help. Though we don’t have specific rooms for nursing babies, we have board rooms that are available to anyone who is in need. There’s complete privacy and any woman is free to use that space. In the past, there were incidents where we have let moviegoers use that room when required. We will put up a notice saying anyone needing help should contact the manager. — Pranab Roy, owner, Menoka Cinema Celebs on nursing moms & their need to socialise Roopa Ganguly In our society, new mothers have always socialised and gone out for work. This is nothing new. I never faced any problem while taking my baby out. It’s the same all over the world — people are travelling with their babies all the time. If someone suggests that a mother should stay home to nurse her child, it is foolish. However, we should also try to look at the other side of the story. I would like to know if the woman sought help from the right person. A guard may not be well trained to handle such situations. We, as a society, lack awareness when it comes to addressing such issues. This cannot change overnight. We all should treat this incident as a lesson and learn to handle such situations better in future. Leena Gangopadhyay What unfolded at a mall recently is inhuman. Any advance society should be able to provide mothers with a room to feed their babies. A mall or theatre can’t be biased against new mothers. It’s not that only young and single men and women should be allowed to enter a theatre, right? If mothers are also your patrons, then provide them with basic facilities to cater to their needs. A woman can’t be locked up in her house for nursing her baby. They head out for work as much as men do. Then why should they think twice before socialising? Sudeshna Roy My son was seven days old when I resumed work. He was breastfed even way after he started eating solid food. I took him to parties and my friends' places because I didn’t want to stop socialising. I think it is one of the basic rights of a mother. Rural women, who work outdoors all day long, do not have the luxury of privacy. They take their children along and feed them when needed, and they are used to it. A mall or a theatre — places that claim to be ‘high-class’ — should provide these basic amenities to women.\",\n",
       " 'There aren’t any bicycle lanes, training facilities or even tolerance towards riders on our roads. Regardless, cyclists are a growing tribe in our country. Clad in their colorful gears they whizz past us on city roads and bylanes for fitness and fun, and many onlookers even throw questions at them in true Mallu style, ‘What would you gain with this kind of circus?’ If you ask a young Samira from Kottayam, she will show you her gold medals, that too won at the national level, just recently! Samira Abraham, a marketing professional who hails from Thazhathangady in Kottayam, took up cycling seriously just two years ago. The 29-year-old, who works in Bengaluru, recently won two golds at the National Road Cycling Championship organised by the Cycling Federation of India at Kurukshetra, Haryana. \"We can take part only in two individual events at the national level at this competition. The medals I won are for 30 km individual time trial and 60 km mass start. Last year too, I had taken part in the event, representing Karnataka. But this year, I decided to cycle for Kerala,\" says Samira. She became aware of the interesting cycling scene of the country only in 2016. Joining the cycling community of Bengaluru for fun, the passion soon consumed her and Samira competed at the national level in the same year! “I won a third prize and there on, I got a lot more involved in this sport,” says Samira, who has also been a triathlete. She had grabbed wins in the South Asian triathlon in Nepal in April this year and the national triathlon championship in Vizag in March. The term triathlon often brings to mind events like Ironman, but Samira says the events she is part of are different. “I take part in Olympic distance triathlons, which have a 1.5 km swim, 40 km cycling and 10 km run. It is more about the speed, in contrast to the other versions of the sport,” she says. Regardless of the triathlon achievements, Samira says cycling has been her major focus for the year. “I went for the State trials of road cycling in Thiruvananthapuram in September and from there, got selected for the national event,” she recalls. An alumnus of Pallikkoodam, a non-conventional school in Kottayam, Samira says she always wanted to be a sportsperson. \"I have been into sports since I was eight and ever since, playing a sport was a daily affair. I always wanted to be an athlete. I used to work towards it even while continuing education and my profession. Just that the right opportunity presented itself later in life,” says the cyclist, who was an active swimmer and athlete while at school too. She puts in about two to four hours of training daily and mostly finishes with her cycling practices in the morning itself, when the traffic isn’t much. Where is the time for it all, while pursuing a career? “I owe those skills to my school. It’s from there that I learnt to manage both sports and the core job effectively,” she says. What are the challenges of being a serious cyclist and triathlete in our country? “Of course, there isn’t enough infrastructure and I end up commuting a lot just to find the right place to train. You don’t even have much time to recover due to the time spent, commuting. While Kerala doesn’t offer a lot of proper environs to practice, Bengaluru is comparatively better. Then again, we don’t have empty roads to practise. We don’t have open waters to train either. But then, if you are doing sports in India and are passionate about it, you must make do with the available resources,” she says. Samira credits her family for her athletic achievements. “Both my parents, Talita and Ravi Abraham, have been very supportive and I truly feel grateful and blessed for it. I consider it God\\'s grace,” she says. Samira signs off saying that she wants to represent India at elite, international events. “I believe that if you want something, you should work for it and go after it, it will happen. Nothing works like hard work, and the growth that happens during the journey is precious.”',\n",

An elated Chezhiyan informs, “To Let was selected under three sections at the IFFI — Indian Panorama, Centenary Award for the Best Debut Feature Film of a Director and International Competition. This is the first time in the IFFI’s 49-year history that a Tamil film made it to the International Competition section. And this is also the first time that a Tamil film has received a special mention at the festival.” There were 15 films that were in the international section, and apart from the three winners, To Let earned a special mention.   Interestingly, IFFI 2018 marks the 100th film festival in which the film has been screened, and the special mention happens to be its 27th award.  Talking about his experiences at the fest, Chezhiyan says, “We had a full house when we presented the film for the first time, on November 23. It was thrilling to watch the film along with the festival audience. Even though we were screening with subtitles, they responded to the lighter moments in the film instantly and that was quite heartening to witness. Though there were no post-screening discussions, people did come up to us to speak about the film after it was over, calling it a bold attempt from the Tamil film industry. There were many college students who had come to the screening and they appreciated the technical aspects of the film, including the performances, the sound design and the editing.”   Seeing the response that the film had, the IFFI organisers also invited him to be part of a half-an-hour face-to-face interaction on their official channel, reveals the director. “And because there was demand for tickets to our film, they screened it two more times during the festival,” he adds.',\n",

His family members have demanded justice and compensation from the accused persons who have reduced him to this state. Dande is not able to speak and lift his arms and a leg due to the horrific attack on October 26 when he was beaten up and hit on the head with a bucket by the men without any apparent provocation. “Our father was a watchman for a showroom in Kopri. He was on duty on that day when a group of men attacked him. The CCTV footage shows how he was beaten up even after he had passed out. His attackers should be jailed and pay monetary compensation for his treatment as we cannot afford private hospital,” said his married city based daughter, Lalita S. When TOI contacted the APMC police station, where the FIR was registered, the senior inspector Satish Nikam said, “So far, two of the accused persons in this case were arrested on charges of grievous assault. They are autorickshaw drivers residing in Koparkhairane. The third accused is still absconding but our investigation is on to track him down.” Activist Anarjit Chauhan, who is trying to legally help the watchman's family, said, “The police should have also charged the accused for attempt to murder. Also, as per the CCTV footage, there were four to five persons beating him; hence robbery attempt charge should also be registered.” Nikam said that the police “are sincerely following the case''. The arrested accused are Pandharinath Pawaskar (33) and Ankush Shankar Savale (46) who are out on bail.

NMMT earlier had threatened to stop its bus services to Uran owing to two problems. Following concretisation work, NMMT was forced to terminate its service at Charphata instead of Pensioner Park. Also, the buses were unable to take turns at the Charphata due to traffic jam and other restrictions. NMMT general manager Shirish Aradwad in a letter on Wednesday to the chief officer of UMC had threatened to stop the NMMT bus services to Uran from December 1, 2018. In the letter NMMT had cited that the ongoing concretisation work and subsequent closure of roads to Uran city had forced the termination of the bus service at Charphata instead of Pensioner Park. Besides, the buses are unable to take U-turns at Charphata and around ONGC due to persistent traffic jams and other restrictions imposed by the traffic police. Aradwad said, “Following our communication, the Uran Municipal Council has taken prompt action and have provided a plot for ensuring smooth operation of our bus services.” NMMT has four routes with 38 buses making 150 trips per day. The NMMC transport wing has four routes to Uran. The route numbers are 30, 31, 34 and 39. These buses ferry thousands of commuters between Navi Mumbai and Uran via Ulwe, Jasai, Karalphata, Dronagiri and JNPT township.

       " 'NEW DELHI: A day after an employee of a restaurant at Saket’s Anupam Complex died of stab wounds, his family members claimed that it was a murder and accused some of the victim’s colleagues of trying to hush up the incident. However, cops are probing the possibility of a suicide in which they suspect the man, Hemant Kumar, held a knife to his chest and stabbed himself. His family members said that police could not provide evidence to prove this. It was found that the CCTV cameras facing the kitchen at the eatery did not have a recorder. A knife seized from the spot, which is suspected to have been used to kill Kumar, has also been sent for forensic analysis for fingerprints, since cops did not find any bloodstains on it. The family staged a protest at the Saket police station demanding an FIR for murder to be registered on Friday evening. Though cops had detained three of his colleagues, they claimed to be innocent. DCP (south) Vijay Kumar said that so far no evidence indicating a murder has been recovered. “We have kept all options open in the probe and are waiting for the forensic reports to establish the reason behind the death,” said Kumar. Kumar’s brother Puneet claimed that a senior manager from the eatery had informed him about the incident after he was declared dead at a private hospital in Malviya Nagar. According to him, his brother had taken up jobs on double shifts at different places to earn extra money for his family members. “Why would someone doing well in his job take such an extreme step?” said Puneet. However, a preliminary probe revealed that Kumar had fallen out with his parents a few months ago due to which he often stayed separately. He also talked of being left unfed for days with some of his friends who stay at Dakshinpuri. While being questioned, his colleagues told the cops that on Thursday evening, Kumar seemed to be disturbed about something due to which he was not able to concentrate on work. He was also pulled up for serving wrong orders to customers. Police said that Kumar used to work in the kitchen and took down orders that the waiters at the restaurant placed before them.

       " 'Chennai: Noting that every legal representative who suffers because of the death of a person due to a motor vehicle accident should have a remedy of compensation, Madras high court has said even brothers and sisters of such person are eligible for compensation if their dependency on the deceased is proved. It is settled principle that the liberal view must be taken to legal heirs of the deceased who died intestate. If the heirs are mother, married and unmarried sisters, married sister will not be considered as dependent. When there are dependents and non-dependents, only dependents are entitled to compensation, Justice M V Muralidaran said. In the case on hand, the appellant in her evidence deposed that before the accident the deceased was residing with her and there were no other legal heirs. No contra evidence was adduced by the insurance company to disprove the version of the appellant. Since the appellant has filed relationship certificate to show that she is the sister of the deceased and in the absence of any other legal heirs, it is to be presumed that the appellant is the only dependent of the deceased. The appellant claimed as living together with the support of deceased being the only legal representative is entitled under personal law to compensation to the extent of loss of estate and to the extent of loss of dependency, the judge added. The court made the observations on the plea moved by Malliga, whose brother Ganapathy died in a road accident in 2011. Partly allowing the plea, the court directed the insurer to pay Rs 2 lakh with 7.5% interest from the date of moving the compensation application in eight weeks.',\n",
       " 'Chennai: Alleging that railway unionist N Kanniah is illegally occupying the post of chairman of Railway Employees Co-operative Credit Society Limited for the past 20 years against the provisions of the Multi State Co-operative Societies Act, a member of the society has approached the Madras high court seeking his removal. Admitting the plea, Justice V Bharathidasan ordered notice to the society, Kanniah, and the central registrar of the Multi State Co-operative Societies returnable in four weeks. According to the petitioner, Kanniah has remained chairman of the society since 1998 and his continuance for more than two terms as per the Act is a blatant violation of the statute. “As per section 44(2) of the Act if any person was chairman when the Act came into force in 2002, that term would be considered as being one term for the purpose of calculating the number of terms in office. Admittedly, Kanniah was chairman from 1998 and when the Act came into force in 2002. Therefore, he had served one term as chairman for the purposes of this Act,” counsel for petitioner said. The petitioner had learned that he was supposedly elected to the post by way of elections allegedly conducted on January 29, 2018. This is the fifth consecutive term he has been continuing as chairman, she added. He wanted the court to direct the registrar to ensure that Kanniah demits office of chairman and to fill the post in accordance with the Act.',\n",

After the session, which lasted just 22 minutes, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that there was a breach of privilege and that speaker P Sreeramakrishnan was behaving like an autocrat. The speaker, later, told reporters that the opposition’s privileges are subject to rules and regulations, but that he was open to criticism and had no ill-feeling towards any individual. Opposition members disrupted the session when the speaker denied permission for an adjournment motion to discuss ‘poor facilities’ at Sabarimala after suspending question hour. The opposition said the speaker had already communicated to senior Congress member K C Joseph that the motion would be rejected as it had ‘nothing new’. With opposition discarding his offer to present the Sabarimala issue as a submission after the question hour, and continuing to shout slogans near his podium, the speaker adjourned the House after rushing through the listed business of the day in 22 minutes. The Wednesday’s session had lasted just 21 minutes.

       " 'SANNIDHANAM: From next pilgrimage season onwards, pilgrims will be transported for free between Nilackal and Pamba in battery-operated eco-friendly buses. At present, private vehicles are only allowed till Nilackal, the base camp of Sabarimala, and the pilgrims will have to use KSRTC buses paying Rs 150 (AC buses) and Rs 80 (non AC) for the to and fro journey. Travancore devaswom board (TDB) president A Padmakumar told TOI that several organizations from outside Kerala had voluntarily come forward to run this project, which he said will begin next season. He said the move would help preserve the serenity of the forest and the eco system. “No diesel or petrol vehicles will be allowed beyond Nilackal from next season,” he added. Another project in the pipeline is a rope way connecting Pamba hill top to Sabarimala. “Apart from bringing materials, this ropeway could also be used for transporting anyone in case of an emergency. The plan is being prepared,” Padmakumar said. The state government and the TDB had decided against any constructions on the banks of Pamba after the deluge. “Sabarimala was cut off from Pamba after the floods for several days. Such a thing should not happen again. A bridge will be constructed across Pamba, connecting hill top to the Ganapathy temple. The cost is estimated around Rs 25 crore. The work for this will begin in January,” the TDB chief said. Those stretches along the traditional path to Sannidhanam from Pamba, which the pilgrims find it difficult to negotiate, will wear a different look next season. Padmakumar said there are certain stretches where the pilgrims fail to get grip. In such places new stones will be laid and steps will be made wherever necessary. He also said that a new path was planned for the devotees to return quickly to Pamba after darshan. “Our aim is to give at least one-minute time for a devotee for Ayyappa darshan. Now, they hardly get a second. We are working out various options to increase the darshan time,” Padmakumar said. Usually 30-35 people can climb ‘Pathinettam Padi’ in a minute. With police support it becomes 60-75. But during last ‘makaravilakku’ over 90 people climbed the holy steps in a minute, he said. The TDB is keen to relocate all the offices and residences of tanthri and head priest from Sannidhanam. He also said that unnecessary construction would not come up in Sabarimala hereafter and the TDB was focusing only on providing toilet facilities, drinking water and food for pilgrims and not encouraging people to stay there. He also said that he had asked the people concerned to restore the well which was used for drawing water for performing ‘abhishekam’ in the temple. “Drawing water from this well manually for abhishekam was a tradition. But the well got closed over years,” he added. “In the same way, the spring in the Bhasmakkulam was also filled up. The water in the pond got that unique smell and colour because of this spring. I have asked to dig it to open the spring again,” he added. Padmakumar also said that the TDB would develop Chengannur as the gateway of Sabarimala. The development work around Chengannur temple was estimated around Rs 18.5 lakh. For the first phase, Rs 9.75 lakh has been taken from KIIFB, he said.',\n",

The 11-km long Alipiri pedestrian route, considered an ancient routen trodden by many from great saints to millions of common devotees even when no motorable road existed, has been a classic case of neglect in the last few years. Though the other pedestrian route, ‘Srivari Mettu’, is much shorter and saves a lot of time and energy, devotees prefer to trek up to Tirumala through the Alipiri route because of the sanctity attached to it. Yet, TTD has literally turned a blind eye to this route which is used by around 20,000 devotees on any given day, with the number crossing 50,000 on weekends. K Yugandhar, a local devotee who often uses the Alipiri route, said the concrete roof has developed cracks at various places and is on the verge of collapsing to the ground at some places. “It’s a cause of worry for those using this route to climb.

AP’s Pollution Control Board too was asked to explain the phenomena and the possible corrective steps that need can be taken. The bench of chief justice TB Radhakrishnan and justice SV Bhatt was hearing a plea filed by Katta Ranga Rao, a resident of Polavaram village, charging the authorities with inaction in protecting the people from the frightening consequences of the illegal dumping of muck and soil excavated from the ongoing Polavaram irrigation project. Even at the dumping sites, the earth beneath cannot bear the weight of the dump beyond a point and the action of the contractors in resorting to reckless disposal of the excavated mud is leading to several problems, the petitioner said. The petitioner’s counsel Neeli Arjun Kumar told TOI that a lot of excavated material from the project is being dumped by the contractor in a reckless and unscientific manner and that the recent cave-in of a nearly half-a-kilometer stretch of road near the project had terrified people in Polavaram and other nearby villages. People are terrified that their homes may face similar upheavals at night and they may be buried alive, which is why they are sleeping outside their homes, Arjun said, adding that these frightening incidents are happening because the authorities are violating the norms related to dumping sites left, right and centre. Not adhering to the norms in respect of the bearing capacity of the supporting soil and lack of lime or stone column stabilisation at the dumping site are a few reasons for the dreaded phenomena being witnessed in and around Polavaram project area, he said. The petitioner expressed apprehension that the authorities are ignoring norms due to pressure from the political leadership that wants the project construction to be hastened at any cost. They are only worried about setting world records in completing the project but not about our lives, Arjun said. The petitioner’s counsel sought a direction from the court to the authorities to form an expert committee to study such violations at dumping sites and the actual reasons for the recent cave-in of the road so that the fears of the villagers about their safety are allayed.',\n",

It will assist Delhi Police in cyber policing, social media analysis and image processing.

This poses a technological challenge for the police. “In the hyper-connected world of tomorrow, it will become hard to imagine a ‘computer crime’, and perhaps any crime, that does not involve electronic evidence linked with internet protocol connectivity,” said IIIT-D director Ranjan Bose. The institute also said that Delhi Police is in the process of modernising its operations and actively exploring the possibility of using state-of-the-art technology to combat crime and manage law and order. So it has become important to involve research organisations, universities and private organisations operating in specialised fields like engineering, technology, law and public policy. “This specialised centre will provide Delhi Police with the opportunity to utilise technology for ‘smart policing’ by using Artificial Intelligence and other new tools,” Bose added. The centre would also start a few courses for students in the future to teach them police practices and investigation technology. The centre would also bring world-class researchers in biometrics, image processing, data and network forensics, social network analysis, cyber security, wireless communications and augmented reality to solve technical issues faced by law enforcement personnel every day. The idea is to research and develop technology and programs with the use of cutting edge IT. The centre would train personnel to acquire knowledge in using latest tools and techniques to aid other aspects of policing like traffic management, disaster management, urban crime and terrorism.

After stopping him, the three started thrashing him and also hit his head with the butt of the revolver while the victim tried resisting the robbery bid,” said a senior police officer on Friday. People on the road remained mute spectators and were in panic. Some people started running away from the spot. “It appears that the robbers had done a recce, as they were aware about the time when the employee Syed, used to return and visit his employer’s house for depositing the cash,” said an officer. Almost after half-an-hour, a team of police officers reached the spot. “The victim got some stitches on his head and was unconscious. We have been collecting the footage from the private CCTV cameras installed at the ATMs and other public places near the spot where the incident took place,” the officer added. Similar incidents like the murder of a CA aspirant on the Jhotwara flyover, were witnessed in the past in the city.',\n",

A similar grant was being given to cow shelters between 2016 - 2018 but was limited to the shelters that had cows between 150-200 in number. However this year, grant will be given to cow shelters having 100-200 cows so as to rope in more shelters. But with the elections just a few days away, it was considered as a step for wooing voters. “Government is already giving Rs 16 to Rs 32 per cow everyday to the cow shelters having cows more than 200 in number. This is the first time shelters having cows up to 100 to 200 will get the benefit as it is financially difficult to run the cow shelter for them as well,” said Vishram Meena, director, cow welfare department, Rajasthan. The scheme was proposed in September, 2018 but due to some technicalities, it was pending and the matter ultimately went to the election commission after the implementation of the model code of conduct in the state. The orders clearing the grant were issued on Thursday. There are about 1,745 cow shelters in the state, out of which 322 cow shelters have cows within 100-200 in number. The decision taken will cost around Rs three crore, 22 lakh to the government. Along with this, election commission allowed two appointments in energy department and appointment of LDC of 2013 selected batch.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old woman entrepreneur was attacked by robbers near Preet Vihar metro station in east Delhi while returning home from work on Monday evening.  Jenny (name changed) said she was walking back to her home in Karkardooma and had taken a service lane near Swasthya Vihar to avoid traffic. She is originally from Mumbai and had only recently relocated to Delhi. Two men started following her on a motorcycle. They first slowed down near her and then the man riding pillion snatched her phone from her hand. When she tried to fight back, they scratched her and pushed her to the ground before speeding away. She was hurt on the neck and face during her fightback. “I raised an alarm and called out to security guards of a private bank nearby but nobody came forward to help. They just stood there and watched,” Jenny said. Jenny managed to borrow a phone from a passerby and inform the police. “The police checked CCTV footage from nearby shops, but could not locate the bikers. I was too traumatised to remember their features,” she told TOI. In her complaint, Jenny told the police that she couldn’t note down the number of the bike either but that it was a black Pulsar. Locals said there were at least two other snatchings around the area in the past one week. Three days before Jenny was attacked, a housewife from Rohini was walking towards Nirman Vihar metro station while talking on the phone. It was around 3.30pm that a man on a scooter with his face covered drove up to her from the wrond side and snatched away her phone. She raised an alarm but nobody came forward to help her, she said. Later, she managed to inform the police and was shown the CCTV footage to identify the scooterist. A case was registered. Another similar incident was, however, solved after a policeman managed to get hold of the snatcher while he was fleeing with a stolen mobile phone near PSJ Road in Preet Vihar. The snatcher, identified as Sunny, had attacked a businessman near a banquet hall. “It was found that Sunny was involved in similar cases in Jagatpuri, Geeta Colony and Preet Vihar earlier. The scooter was also found to be stolen from Shakarpur,” said DCP (east) Pankaj Singh. He has also asked the area ACP and SHO to step up patrolling.',\n",
       " 'UDAIPUR: Former Lok Sabha MP and the scion of the erstwhile Mewar royal family, Maharana Mahendra Singh, has disclosed that “someone” approached him and his son with a hefty sum of money to secure the royal family’s go ahead for the release of controversial Padmaavat earlier this year. Padmaavat, a film on the life of queen Padmavati, wife of the 13th century Rajput ruler Rawal Ratan Singh, was opposed by members of the community in several states. While the film was allowed to be released in some states after some modification and emphasis by its director Sanjay Leela Bhansali that it was a work of fiction, Padmaavat continues to be banned in Rajasthan. Singh, 77, is the senior most living descendant of Rawal Ratan Singh. The erstwhile Mewar royal family, along with other members of the Rajput community, had also opposed Padmaavat’s release earlier this year. Elaborating on how his family was approached, Singh told TOI: “There was an unforgivable scene when someone came to me with the offer that if I stopped objecting to the film they would give me a lot of money. I could have nearly slapped the man and thrown him out. I am sorry about this, I am not a violent person.” However, Singh, former MP from Chittorgarh, did not reveal the identity of the person or the amount offered by the latter. He also said that the makers of the film and the censor board approached him to seek his sanction for the film but the move was belated. “The filmmakers themselves approached us asking for our approval. That was before the release of the movie. Censor board people came to us. I said it’s too late. Finally, I told them, ‘If we are going to make a suggestion, how much of it you are going to accept?’ They bungled up. We were going into unspoken impasse. There was a breakdown,” he said. Singh said the objection to the movie was not just by Rajputs but all sections of society in Mewar and neighbourhood regions. “I have not seen the movie. I am not going to see it either. From the reports I got, there are scenes objectionable in Padmavati. All sorts of society members thought there was nonsense in the movie which is not going to be liked,” he said.',\n",

       " 'Trichy: Continuing its efforts to provide green space and recreational facilities to city-dwellers in areas with space crunch, Trichy corporation has launched works for establishing a public park beneath Thennur flyover. Being set up at an estimated cost of Rs 43 lakh, the facility is aimed at making use of the vacant space under the flyover to provide walking track and other recreational amenities for the close-packed Madurai Road residents. Officials said the initiative has been taken following the overwhelming response to the vertical garden-cum-public park established under the Palakkarai flyover at an estimated cost of Rs 32.50 lakh. With civil works having commenced under the Thennur flyover near Ramakrishna theatre, corporation officials said that a 500-foot-long walking track would be established with stone benches on either end. “Since the residential localities around the Thennur flyover including Marakkadai and Madurai Road falling under ward number 19 have less space for recreational activities, the upcoming park will benefit the local people a lot in the evening,” G Kumaresan, assistant executive engineer, Ariyamangalam zone, said. A fountain and vertical garden are on cards in the upcoming public park which falls under Ariyamangalam zone, the officials added. The civic body said that the park is a part of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) to improve liveability as well as green cover available in the congested zones. Apparently, such initiatives will also help Trichy corporation to improve its ranking in the pan-India cleanliness survey, Swachh Survekshan, scheduled for January. As the vacant places were being misused by anti-social elements in the recent past for dumping waste and liquor bottles, residents in Thennur and nearby Kuppankulam have welcomed the move. “We also have a plan to develop a similar park under Gandhi Road flyover in Srirangam falling under ward number 3. Besides developing green spaces, works are simultaneously under way to beautify the walls of government buildings,” N Ravichandran, commissioner, Trichy corporation, said. The civic body has reached an understanding with the state-run Poompuhar handicrafts to paint the walls of corporation buildings with heritage-based themes. Painting works have commenced on the buildings on Madurai Road near the corporation’s lorry shed and government buildings on the other three zones would be beautified with exclusive themes in a month at an estimated cost of Rs 35 lakh. Park under Thennur flyover: Location: Ward number 19, Ariyamangalam zone | Estimated cost: Rs 43 lakh | Length of walking track: 500 feet Facilities: LED lights | Stone seat benches | Garden Other possible locations: Gandhi road flyover in ward number 3, Srirangam.

While it is all right to provide space for people to spend leisure time, residents also pointed out that if the green space also included a parking lot, it would generate revenue for the civic body to maintain the public parks. “By utilising the land below bridges and flyovers to park vehicles and simultaneously grow vertical garden on the pillars of the flyover, Trichy can set a benchmark for other cities to make good use of vacant space,” K P Rangaprasad, joint secretary, Satta Panchayat movement, said. With as many as 1,800 new vehicles hitting the streets every month as per the statistics available with the regional transport office here, residents claimed that space crunch for parking is at its peak in Thillai Nagar, Fort Station Road, and Sasthri Road. As the majority of works for Trichy Junction RoB near central bus stand has been completed, local people also wanted the space beneath the bus stand arm of the flyover to be made available for parking two-wheelers of those visiting the nearby shops. “We have separate plans to promote paid parking in the commercial streets. The demand to provide parking space below the flyovers will also be considered, but we need to study the demand and situation,” corporation commissioner N Ravichandran told TOI. The civic body also has plans to establish latrines and urinals to prevent open defecation and urination in the free spaces beneath the city bridges.

Addressing students of St Pious X Degree, PG and MBA College for Women in Tarnaka on Friday, Harichandana said that the voter percentage in the rural areas was much higher than the urban pockets. “Almost 70% people from rural areas cast their vote. Whereas, in Hyderabad, only 47% exercised their franchise in the last elections. This despite the fact that urban people are educated and aware of their rights,” said Harichandana. Question on candidates’ criminal background during elections by an MBA first student Charishma G drew a huge round of applause among students who unanimously opined that such candidates should not be in the fray. “All politicians have to submit their criminal antecedents thrice in newspapers before the elections. It is up to the voters whether they want to give such candidates a chance or not. There is very little that the government can do about it as ultimately it’s a democracy,” said Harichandana. While students opined that voting does not bring in much of change in the laws claiming that votes are manipulated, the GHMC zonal commissioner cited example of the Nirbhaya Act. “The Nirbhaya Act was introduced and enforced following huge uproar among the people. The youth should put forward their demands to contesting candidates and then cast vote to the one whom they believe will bring the change for them,” said Harichandana. Others questioned the GHMC zonal commissioner on digitising of voting process in future, enforcing closure of malls and multiplexes during the voting day, having retirement age and educational qualification for contesting elections, among others.

Addressing a press conference here, the cricketer-turned-politician alleged that the Kaleshwaram irrigation project redesigned by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is the “Rafale scam” of Telangana. “If the Rafale fighter aircraft deal is the biggest scam at the national level, then Kaleshwaram, the cost of which was increased from 40,000 crore to nearly 90,000 crore in one stroke by KCR, is the biggest scam of Telangana. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM KCR are sailing in the same sinking ship and are bound to drown (lose elections),” Sidhu said. Dubbing the KCR-led family as “ Ali Baba aur char chor” (Ali baba and four thieves), Sidhu alleged that a single family is feeding off the state’s debt resources. “Punjab incurred a huge debt of over 2 lakh crore over a period of 70 years but here in Telangana, debts increased from 60,000 crore to 2.20 lakh crore in just four-and-a-half years,” he said. Sidhu said every child born in Telangana will be born with a 60,000 debt on their head. “Seventy-five per cent of Telangana’s population is below the poverty line with a per capita income of 141 per day.

       " 'HYDERABAD: Animal rights activists in the city welcomed the Centre’s new draft rules to ban use of all animals at circuses or mobile entertainment troupes. While the use of big cats such as tigers and lions is already banned in India, the government is now planning a ban on use of other animals such as elephants, horses and dogs in circuses. The ban was proposed in a recently released draft of Performing Animals (Registration) Amendment Rules, 2018. The new rules will be implemented after a mandatory period of 30 days, and will serve to eliminate animal cruelty. It will also free animals from a life in confined spaces, and performing acts that are painful, said rights activists. Panneru Teja, consultant at Humane Society International/India, said: “We have been waiting for the government to bring in this rule. Animals have been undergoing unnecessary pain and suffering in circus events in Hyderabad, and across the country. The ban is likely to eliminate animal cruelty to a large extent.” Activists said that the Jamuna Circus in Hyderabad is one such entertainment event where animals go through an ordeal. In 2016, activist Dattatreya Joshi conducted a 20-day long operation to rescue one elephant, eight dogs, seven pups, five exotic birds, and six geese. “What we found during the operation was a shocking reminder of the abysmal conditions in which circuses keep their animals,” said Joshi. “We rescued pregnant dogs, which had maggot wounds and injuries caused because of beating. There were birds which were with their feathers and wings cut, and horses with overgrown hooves. The elephant which was rescued also had multiple injuries.” Joshi said, “One does not realise the extremely cruel methods used to make animals perform acts that are not natural to them. The decision to ban the use of these animals is definitely a welcome move.”',\n",

       " 'Trichy: A 50-year-old man was murdered by three men near Manalmedu in Nagapattinam district on Thursday night after they came to know that he had been informing police about their illegal sand mining activities on the Kollidam riverbanks. The deceased has been identified as Murugan Marudhavanan of Sathangudi. The suspects -- R Kanagaraj of Sathangudi, S Jayakumar of Sithamalli and Ranjith of Kurichi – were involved in illegal sand mining, police said. Recently, they came to know that Marudhavanan had been informing police about their illegal mining activities. They decided to murder him. According to police, the murder took place during the intervening nights of Thursday and Friday. Police said that late on Thursday night, Marudhavanan, a former local DMK functionary, had informed the Manalmedu police about a sand mining activity at Kollidam river banks in his area. As a result, a team of police reached the spot. Though they secured the vehicle in which the sand was being smuggled, the driver fled from the spot. The vehicle belonged to Kanagaraj, who later found out that Marudhavanan had tipped off the police. When Marudhavanan was going home on his two-wheeler to his home, he was allegedly intercepted by Kanagaraj and two others - Jayakumar and Ranjith. They attacked him with iron rods resulting in his death. After coming to know about the incident, police reached the spot and conducted investigation. Marudhavanan’s body was sent to the Mayiladuthurai government hospital for postmortem. Mayiladuthurai deputy superintendent of police S Venkatesan said that illegal sand mining was common in the area. He said that Marudhavanan had been serving as a police informant for some time. “During our investigation, we came to know that Marudhavanan himself used to be involved in illegal sand mining before, but he stopped the practice some time back and became a police informant,” the DSP said. He said that only 10 days back, Kanagaraj was caught in an illegal sand mining incident.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Sealing notices have been issued to 103 properties housing over 500 gold-purifying units in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Karol Bagh zone for polluting environment through acid leeching and illegal kilns. A senior official said the action had been taken on the basis of a survey carried out this year to identify polluting units in Beodonpura and Raigarpura. “These industries, operating in residential areas, have been issued notices to vacate the premises within 48 hours. If units are not vacated, we will seal the properties on Monday,” he said. Earlier this year, the civic body had received a specific communication from the Union environment ministry to act against these highly polluting units. On May 16, action was taken against 32 properties housing around 200 gold-purifying units. The corporation has been criticised for letting such industrial units operate in residential areas. The survey has estimated over 1,600 illegal units operating just in Karol Bagh. Last week, four people died in a fire in an illegal clothes packaging unit operating in a residential building. The fire had started after a solvent used for laundering clothes accidentally spilled on the floor. Delhi Fire Services had said the establishment was less than 200 sq ft and did not have any space for stairways for a quick exit or adequate fire safety precautions. Earlier this year, TOI had highlighted how Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) has sent a list of over 51,837 industries operating in non-conforming residential areas, with Karol Bagh having one of the highest densities of such factories-cum-godowns. In 1996, DSIIDC had, under the relocation scheme for industrial establishments, allotted plots to factory owners running units in residential areas. In 2003, the Supreme Court, in the MC Mehta v Union of India case, had directed that all industrial units that had come up in non-conforming areas on or after August 1, 1990 should be closed within a given timeframe. But, even in 2018, many units continue to operate out of residential areas.',\n",

Close to one lakh concrete poles have been brought from Andhra Pradesh to replace damaged electric poles in the cyclone affected areas. However, workers say that many of the sub-standard poles have developed cracks. A 38-year-old contract worker with the electricity board fractured his spinal cord after falling from an electric pole which broke during repair works in Thirumakottai village in Mannargudi of Tiruvarur on Thursday. A 30ft tall cement concrete pole, buried 5ft deep, broke from the base when, Senthil Kumar, who was climbing atop the pole, fell from a height of 20ft. He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Coimbatore. “The accident could have been fatal for had Senthil not managed to land in a safe spot while ensuring that the pole does not fall on him,” said a worker who witnessed the accident. The worker said that poor quality of steel has been used in the pole besides, improper concrete mixture. “The concrete should be kept moist and the poles should be kept for curing for at least 3 months to avoid cracks, but the dates on the poles show that they are less than 2 months old,” said another EB worker attached to CITU trade union. Professor of civil engineering department from NIT-Trichy C Natarajan said that M30 concrete mix ratio should be used in such poles to provide it strength which may not last longer otherwise. “Besides this, a lot depends on the curing time, quality of water and metal used during production,” he said.

But after she got a resounding response from her relatives and family friends, she decided to sell panipuri and masala puri, albeit with a South Indian twist. Vasantha started a small roadside stall initially at Anna Nagar around five years ago and a year and a half later shifted to Palakkarai near the flyover, to come closer to her residence. The delicious taste of her wares led to a spurt in sales and now Vasantha’s chaat stall, which functions from 3.30 pm to 9.30 pm every day, serves up to 50 to 60 customers on a daily basis. Vasantha said that once along with her husband and her three children, she tried out masala puri at a chaat stall and everyone liked it. She decided that she would prepare it at home for her children. \"The first time I made it, it was not in the typical North Indian-style. I just made the gravy for masala puri in a way I make chicken or mutton curry. My children liked it a lot,\" she told TOI. That was how she got inspired to start a food stall so that she could use the income to fund her children’s education. Speaking about the preparation style of masala puri, Vasantha said that all the masalas she used were homemade and in Chettinad style. She said that she added a heavy amount of tomato paste for the masala puri gravy and added chickpeas along with it while cooking. \"In the conventional style, they don’t use tomato paste and any south Indian masala. After making the gravy, I add puri, puffed rice, corn chips and sev. While the gravy tastes south Indian, the other items added are conventional. It finally gives a perfect blend,\" she said.

No sooner did he reach the state capital on Friday, the saint launched a scathing attack on Adityanath for reportedly calling Hindu god Hanuman a Dalit. “Even Raavan (the mythological king) had committed the sin of telling Hanuman’s caste. What end Raavan met is known to all; the BJP leaders will meet the same end,” Krishnam said, addressing a press conference at PCC HQs. He added, “Castes are for the mortals, not for the gods. Someone who is drunk in power commits the insult of trying to tell castes of gods.” Krishnam has been Congress’ star campaigner in elections across the country. The spiritual guru, who founded the Kalki Peeth in Sambhal (UP), would address election rallies in support of Congress candidates in Rajasthan from Saturday. On being asked where he would be campaigning for Congress in the state, Krishnam replied, “At all places where those who tried to tell the god’s caste had gone.” On November 26 and 27, the UP CM had addressed 11 election rallies for BJP candidates in Alwar, Ajmer, Nagaur, Sikar, Churu, Bikaner and Jaisalmer districts. At the poll rally in Malakhera (Alwar) on November 26, Yogi Adityanath had reported said that god Hanuman was a Dalit. The remark drew strong reactions from people, while his party leaders added to the controversy by saying that Hanuman was a tribal, not Dalit. The Congress filed a complaint with the election commission seeking a ban on the UP CM’s rallies in Rajasthan until the elections on December 7. Acharya Krishnam told reporters that the saints were peeved with BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for misleading people and dividing the country. He accused BJP of not fulfilling the six major promises it made to citizens while seeking their votes to come to power at the centre. Krishnam said, “BJP failed to build Ram temple despite getting full majority in parliament, did not bring a law against cow slaughtering, could not end unemployment, instead of abolishing Article 370, formed government in J&K with a party that equates terrorists with martyrs, could not bring back black money but imposed note-bandi and failed to provide relief to farmers.” He added, “Since BJP lied to people, the saints have decided to support Congress and dislodge the ruling party.”',\n",

       " \"Snacking and movie-watching go hand in hand but the genre of the film determines what you order at the theatres, say exhibitors. While comedy and family films see movie buffs ordering a large amount of eatables, chewing popcorn during a horror movie can literally lead to popcorn shaming! Snacks are a must while watching most films but moviegoers say that when it comes to horror and romantic films, it’s indeed a snack-free show. Food sales are lowest during horror movie screenings: exhibitors Have you ever tried eating popcorn while watching a horror movie? Those who have ‘dared’ to do so narrate their experiences where they have felt embarrassed and guilty for spoiling other people’s movie-watching experience. Aakash Dahiya, a lecturer, says, “People shame you for every crunch, every sound. I am not even exaggerating! When I went to watch 'The Nun', I bought a tub of popcorn before the film began. The person seated next to me asked, ‘Are you going to eat this during the movie?’ In a few minutes, I realised what a big mistake I had made. Every crunch sounds so loud that the person in the row in front of you will turn and stare at you. While the person sitting next to you will ask you to be quiet! How can you eat popcorn without making any crunching noise?” Another moviegoer, Anshuman Dutta, who works in a shopping complex, says, “I made this mistake of buying nachos and coffee during the screening of 'The Nun' some time back and it was literally an exhausting experience. Every time I took a bite, it seemed as if I was intentionally trying to scare others. Dur dur se log turn kar ke dekh rahe thay ki awaaz kahan se aa rahi hai? That was the first time when I had ordered food during a horror movie, because I had just finished my shift at work and it was really a bad experience. I lost my appetite within minutes.” Tinku Singh, Group President, SRS Cinemas, says, “People don’t bother to buy food for horror movies because they know that they won’t be able to finish it. If they try eating the food, they might end up scaring others (with the munching noises) who are already terrified. We have the lowest sale of popcorn during horror movies.” Moviegoers further tell us that whenever you buy any crunchy food item during a horror movie screening, you need to devise a strategy – whenever music gets played or there are loud noises on screen, munch on the food! A still from 'Tumbbad' A still from 'Tumbbad' ‘Couples don’t want to be disturbed and share food while watching romantic films’ Another genre of movies which sees the lowest sale of food items is romantic movies. Reason? Who has the time to munch on food when so much is going on, not just on screen but also off it! Yogesh Raizada, Corporate Head, Wave Cinemas, says, “We don’t even bank on horror movies for sale of food items but another major flop at food counters happens when romantic movies are screened. Those who come for romantic movies are mostly couples and they are so busy with themselves that they don’t order food. Sometimes, they may go for a soft drink or a popcorn but that’s also rare.” An usher at a multiplex in Delhi, says, “During the screening of romantic films, the number of orders for snacks is quite low. Most of the couples prefer just one popcorn, that too if they order at all. They may eat out later but very rarely during a film.” Another usher who works at a cinema hall in Noida says that they don’t even disturb couples with order queries. She says, “We have many regulars here. We have noticed that those who order in bulk when they come with friends do not often order at all when they come for a romantic film with partners. Even when we go inside the auditorium to take orders, we prefer to not disturb couples because we know that might irritate them. It’s a romantic movie which they have come to watch with their partners – they are mostly too busy and ordering food is the last thing on their mind. So shows like these obviously hamper our food business a lot.” Family movies and comic films keep the cash counters of food bays ringingCinephiles who are gourmands order food depending on the film they are watching. And there’s no prize for guessing which genre leads to maximum food business at theatres – comedy and family movies. Exhibitors say that movies for which families or friends come together, be it a Hollywood film or a desi entertainer like 'Baahubali', food orders are at the highest. A cinema manager at a multiplex in Delhi explains, “Going by our past experiences, it seems that the genre of the film you are watching and your company matter when it comes to ordering food at cinemas. For some reason, when there is a girls’ group or boys’ gang, they order more and even repeat orders. Also, when it’s a family movie or a comedy, the food orders just keep coming. The staff is assigned accordingly – say, if Screen 3 is showing a horror movie, even two staff members are enough. While if Screen 2 is showing a movie like 'Mamma Mia!' or 'Incredibles 2', I know I will need help. So depending on the film, we assign the ushers.” Agreeing, Devika Tandon, who works in the HR department of an MNC, says, “Of course it’s true. When I am out for a comedy movie which would usually be with friends or family, I know that together, we will be spending Rs2-3K only on food. But when the same set of friends goes with me for a horror film, humhare khane ke paise toh bach hi jate hain!”\",\n",

       " 'Her sheer grit and single-minded determination to pursue her dreams is what sets her apart. Born with a hearing impairment to simple, middle-class parents (mother is a homemaker and father is a chief engineer with the Railways), 23-year-old Nishtha Dudeja has overcome multiple troubles in her life and is now all set to receive the National Award for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities in the category of ‘Role Model’ on December 3, at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi. Instituted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, this award is given by the President of India to differently abled persons, who have accomplished a lot, despite their disabilities. Nishtha, who is pursuing her Masters in Economics from Mithibai College, is also a sportsperson with medals in judo, tennis in regional, national and international levels, and has represented India in Deaflympics 2013 (Bulgaria), World Deaf Tennis Championship 2015 (UK) and Deaflympics 2017 (Turkey). Prior to her departure for the capital to receive the award, Nishtha and her father spoke to us about she being the first Indian to bag the crown at the Miss Deaf Asia 2018 pageant, her trails and tribulations, the problems faced by those with hearing impairments and why she loves Mumbai so much. Excerpts... You are the first Indian to win the title of Miss Deaf Asia 2018 — what was the first thought that came to your mind when you won? When the judges announced ‘India...’ and I saw my parents’ smiling faces, it meant the world! Last year, I’d found out about this pageant online and attended the 2017 edition of the contest with my dad, to figure out what it was about and all that it entailed. That day, I promised myself that I’d be on stage in 2018. I worked towards it for a year and won! While growing up, how did you deal with bullies and others who’d treat you badly because you were differently abled? During my initial years of schooling, many children made fun of me as I had a speech defect due to my hearing impairment. I was mentally strong, so I used to either ignore or counsel them not to treat differently abled children like that. It was difficult to make friends. Later, I learnt to give it back to them. Jab log mujhe bahut tang kartein the, chidhathe the, toh main unhe marti bhi thi. I used my judo knowledge on them. Once, when we were kids, someone hit my brother and that angered me, so I beat him up and bit his arm, too. He never troubled my brother again! Did your family shower you with special attention? I am lucky to have been born in a family that has treated me like a normal child and allowed me to pursue my dreams. My mother’s initiative to put me into sports was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me, as it channelised my energy towards constructive goals. This taught me sportsmanship and imbibed a competitive spirit in me. The most important thing that I have learnt from my parents is to ‘never give up’. I have imbibed the ‘never say die spirit’ from them. You are a Delhi girl, why did you choose Mumbai for your post graduation? What is it about this city that you like? I always wanted to do my PG here because of Mumbai’s vibrant culture and also because I wanted to live independently. This is a lovely and safe city to stay in, with nice and understanding people. And the most spectacular thing here is Mumbai ka samundar! I particularly love Marine Drive. I can just spend the whole day there doing nothing. What do you think are the challenges that children with disabilities face in our country? There are two major problems. The first is the lack of awareness about the availability of technology. For example, when I was diagnosed with a hearing impairment, only analogue hearing aids were available and still we made use of the available technology to develop speech. Nowadays, sophisticated digital and programmable hearing aids are available, but there is a lack of awareness. Sometimes, hearing aids are not used for the fear of ‘log kya kahenge?’ The other problem which we are facing is the lack of resources and their affordability. For example, there are only about 2,500 certified speech therapists in India for an estimated hearing impaired population of 70 lakhs. What do you have to say about the education for differently abled people in India? The government has kept five per cent seats in higher education and four per cent seats in jobs reserved for differently abled persons. But more than 80 per cent of the seats reserved in higher education remain vacant. So, the real challenge is to strengthen the primary and secondary education to reduce the rate of drop-outs. There is a lack of awareness about the facilities and technical solutions available to mitigate disabilities. Our society must come forward to create awareness and pool resources so that these facilities reach the poorest. Also, teachers and parents need to be more sensitive towards the needs of differently abled children. How do you feel about winning the National Award? I feel grateful, empowered and humbled. It has brought upon me added responsibilities as many people may get inspired from my achievements. I’d never thought of winning a National Award. I just followed my heart and tried to give my best to whatever I did.',\n",

       " 'GAYA: The Gaya district administration along with environmentalists and other stakeholders, including representatives of the civil society and business bodies on Thursday mulled the strategy to curb air pollution in the town. District magistrate Abhishek Singh chaired the meet. A recent WHO report put Gaya as the fourth most polluted city in the world. High pollution level, it is feared may discourage foreign tourists and pilgrims, particularly the visitors from the affluent countries of Europe and the USA. Some immediate measures decided at the meet, included regular water sprinkling on city roads. Dust particles were identified as the most potent threat to local environment. Experts claimed that Falgu sand dust pollutes the Gaya air the most as the river remains mostly dry. As per the decisions taken at the meet, besides regular sprinkling of water in Gaya Municipal Corporation area, covering of construction material, including cement, sand, stone chips and bricks during transportation have been made mandatory. As of now tractor loads of uncovered construction material are dumped near the construction sites. The cover mandate will apply during transportation as well as storage at construction site. Exterior curtain for buildings under construction have also been made compulsory. Environmentalists present at the meet recommended detailed study of waste- dumping pattern in the city and complete ban on open- burning of municipal waste. Emission test of old vehicles plying on Gaya roads has also been recommended. On account of non- availability of relevant data, a more comprehensive discussion could not take place. The DM also directed the officials concerned to provide the required statistics for a detailed study and integrated pollution control strategy. It was also decided in the meet to conduct a detailed survey of roadside dhabas and other eateries using coal and wood as fuel. Stone crushing units have been directed to use cleaner techniques to reduce the level of air pollution. Event organisers planning a gathering of more than 150 persons will now have to seek prior permission of municipal authorities. This will also apply for sporting events. The long-pending demand for establishment of electric crematorium at the Vishnupad temple also cropped up at the meet. As per reports, conservative elements are opposed to the establishment of electric crematorium as use of wood for cremation is the traditional practice.

       " \"The much-awaited #Nickyanka wedding celebrations began with the couple and their friends and family arriving in Jodhpur on Thursday morning. Among the first ones to arrive were Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, with Nick’s brother Joe and Sophie Turner. Priyanka and Nick’s families also arrived soon after them. For the other guests, there were around 10 attendants (from the event management company) waiting at a booth set up inside the airport to help them with their luggage and transport. One of Nick’s friends who flew in from LA told us, “This looks grand. We all are so excited for five days of celebrations. This will be a special wedding.” The two will reportedly get married in a Christian ceremony today, which will be officiated by Nick’s father, and a Hindu ceremony on December 2, for which Nick will arrive on horseback.

According to our sources, the 10 page non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prevents anyone from posting anything on social media, taking pictures and even talking about the wedding to anyone not invited for it. If the agreement is breached, one will have to pay their entire bill amount as penalty. For instance, if a vendor’s bill is Rs20 lakh for the services he has provided for the wedding, as a penalty, he will have to pay the entire amount. Like Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s wedding, mobile phones have also been banned. Nick Jonas’ parents, Denise Miller-Jonas and Paul Kevin Jonas, Sr, at the Jodhpur airport on Thursday  As per sources, there was a family brunch and cocktail dinner on Thursday. The venue, Umaid Bhawan Palace, was all lit up for the grand event and the security outside the entrance was so strict that no one was even allowed to wait or stand on the road leading to the Palace. The security guards informed us that taking pictures even outside the venue was not allowed and those working for the wedding prep have been strictly told not to take any pictures. “Cell phone cameras have been covered with tape so that no one can take any pictures. Everyone has been strictly instructed to not discuss the wedding details with anyone,” a member from the event management company who was stationed outside the airport told us.

The hair and makeup team that flew in from Mumbai told us, “We are not supposed to talk to anyone about the wedding.” Umaid Bhawan Palace has flown in management staff from across India especially for Priyanka and Nick’s wedding. One of the staff members told us, “We have come from different properties of the hotel group across India to be a part of the management team at Umaid Bhawan Palace.”  Nick’s elder brother Kevin Jonas was also spotted at the airport with wife Danielle Jonas  Priyanka’s mehendi is from the same manufacturer who provided henna for Aishwarya Rai and Liz Hurley’s weddings Around 5.5 kg of henna has been ordered from Natural Herbals, a Sojat-based henna manufacturer, for Priyanka’s mehendi function. Nitesh Agarwal, owner, shared, “Around a month ago, a few people from the wedding management team and a beautician, who had good knowledge of henna, came to Sojat to meet us. They took samples of our henna and after that they gave us the final order. One week ago, 5.5 kg of henna packets were sent from Sojat to Mumbai.” The same manufacturer supplied henna for Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan’s wedding and also for Liz Hurley’s wedding in Udaipur.  Sojat, also known as Mehandi Nagri, is the main henna producing area of India, and over 90% of the country’s annual production takes place here.  #Nickyanka’s Delhi reception on December 4   Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh aka Superwoman will also be a part of Priyanka-Nick's wedding   After winding up celebrations in Jodhpur, the couple and their families will reach Delhi on December 4, say sources. The Delhi reception will be held at a five-star hotel and apart from Priyanka’s family in Delhi, some of her close friends are expected to attend the reception.\",\n",
       " \"Grammy-nominated music producer, DJ Snake loves India. So much so that he is set to foot in the country again this month to perform on the New Year’s eve. In an exclusive interview with BT, the musician talks about his love for the country, what inspires his music and why chart ratings and awards don’t matter to him. Edited excerpts: You love India. You’re visiting the country again. I’ll perform on New Year’s eve. India is a special place to me. I filmed my video for Magenta Riddim here. It has a special place in my heart. The fans, culture, music — I love everything about the country. My fans in India are so loyal.   You‘ve often expressed your wish to work on a Bollywood project. Is there anything in the pipeline? I keep getting offers, but I never get the time to take on one. I definitely want to do that. You collaborated with Selena Gomez. Ozuna and Cardi B for your latest project. Tell us about the experience of working with them?  I wanted to make a reggaeton record. So I sent the record to Ozuna and he killed it. Then I felt like I wanted to add a more female vibe but still keep some Spanish touch, so I asked Selena and Cardi and it all came together. It’s a difficult process to put so many artistes on one record, but honestly, it just all came together perfectly. I was blessed.  How did this collaboration come about?  I sent the beat to Ozuna. I always liked the tone of his voice, and his live shows are fire. So I sent it to him and he sent me back his piece. After that, adding Selena and Cardi was obvious and they both really liked each other so it became a real family thing.  The song did well. What do you think worked?  It’s timeless and fresh. It pops out at you. It’s important to me that my music stands out. Taki Taki doesn’t sound like anything else out there and it’s hard to do that when you are on the road all the time, but it’s really important to me that how people feel about my work. It was the same with Magenta Riddim. You've featured on the Billboard charts several times. What does being on such coveted charts mean to you?  It’s always nice to feel the recognition. But I make records of all sizes. I make music I want to. I never do it to get chart positions. And do awards matter to you?   They don’t. Playing my music to fans and people enjoying it is what matters; that makes me happy as an artiste. If you start worrying about awards, you will lose your creativity.  What keeps you going as a musician?   Music. It’s all I have ever wanted to do. And to always grow and learn and be better. You can never stop learning or being inspired. Why do we see so many culture influences in your music?   I grew up surrounded by all types of cultures. French, Indian, Arabic, a melting pot of cultures, sounds, foods, people and religions. It opened my eyes early, and I’m grateful for that. It’s not about success in one area; it’s about exploring the world musically and spending time in those places whenever you can. Getting into the streets, seeing and meeting people, hearing their music, tasting their food, the fabrics they use in clothes, their skyline, their beliefs fascinates me.\",\n",
       " 'Sparsh Shah has had over 125 live performances to his credit including four at Madison Square Garden, Berkley Center with close to over 30,000 people in attendance. He has performed and spoken in six countries across the globe, bagged scholarships and multiple awards including the prestigious Global Indian Award (only seven other Indians can boast of winning it) and has been on several TV shows including Ellen DeGeneres’ Little Big Shots.  But this 15-year-old child prodigy — singer, songwriter, rapper and inspirational speaker — a New Jersey resident, finally had his dream come true recently when he was invited for the Kaun Banega Crorepati finale with Amitabh Bachchan. “One of my biggest goals had been performing for a billion people, and with this show, I managed to touch many more. Now I am aiming for the Grammy,” says the boy. Sparsh lived up to Big B’s introduction of him as Awaaz ke jaadugar and ‘wonder-kid’.   In a candid interaction with Bombay Times, Sparsh and his father Hiren, spoke about the young musician’s love for music, the challenges he has overcome and how he has stayed positive throughout his journey. Trained in both Hindustani and Western music Born with the brittle-bone disease, a congenital condition, osteogenesis imperfecta, he had 40 fractures as a new-born. Post 130 surgeries, eight rods and 22 screws in his body, Sparsh has defied all odds in life and turned all the “impossible’ to ‘i’m possible”. “As a toddler, he would be singing, humming and also correcting us about pitch, key, notes. We recognised his talent and got him trained in Western and Indian classical music (Mewati Gharana),” says Hiren. Sparsh adds, “Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj ji is the doyen of this gharana.”  An original artiste “I’ve been an original artiste since I was 10 and my first song was, This Love Will Never Fail. I have written over 30 original songs. My first cover of Eminem is huge and has been appreciated by followers in over 100 different countries,” he says.  Music is the greatest healer Music has been the greatest healer because it really touches his soul. “For me, it is like therapy. Only music can bring people together. If you put music between them, people from all walks of life, all over the world will bond faster than they usually bond over decades. It’s that powerful. It touches the core of our being and spirit,” he states.   His knowledge in music is astounding  Talking about his extensive musical expertise his father shares, “We were watching the Grammy Awards once, during the time Adele’s Hello became a huge hit. She began singing on stage and Sparsh told me, ‘Dad she is off key’. And I was like, ‘Sparsh, stop. This is Adele’. Thirty seconds later, Adele stopped singing and said, ‘I am so sorry. Can we restart? I was off key’.”    Dissing the disability  Sparsh never felt that his disability was a burden. “I haven’t ever been ashamed of it. Usually, people have this huge misconception that people like us feel disabled and small. Go to any person with a disability — they will tell you they are much stronger than what they seem to be. Because they have a strength of heart and soul — a God-given gift. God was kind to let me live through the 40 fractures. I’ve always believed that good or bad, everything ultimately happens for the good. That’s my secret to positivity. BTW, the word disabled needs to be updated. I like to say that I diss my disability.”',\n",

       " 'Manisha Lakhe: It’s basic decency to inform an author that you are adapting her book into a film   Shashanka Ghosh: She wrote the book based on the screenplay which Rajesh Devraj and I wrote   After it was reported on Thursday, November 29, that director Shashanka Ghosh (Veere Di Wedding, Khoobsurat) will collaborate with Naseeruddin Shah, Ratna Pathak Shah and Anupam Kher to bring Manisha Lakhe’s 2010 novel (The BetelNut Killers) to the big screen, it left the author infuriated, as she wasn’t even informed about it.  Manisha told BT, “The report quotes producer Joy B Ganguly saying, ‘The idea came to Shashanka when he was travelling to the US in the late ’90s.’ When did this become Shashanka’s idea? Just because I shared my idea with him, how can I not have any rights over it? How can it suddenly become his idea? It’s basic decency to inform an author that you are adapting her book into a film.”   Recalling her conversation with Shashanka years ago, Manisha explained, “In the 80’s and 90’s Indian food wasn’t easily available in the US. The BetelNut Killers is story told from an NRI’s point of view. When I was based in Portland, Shashanka, who is a friend (we worked in the same ad agency), had come over for lunch. I had shared the idea of a dark comedy revolving around Indian grocery stores in that area with him. I was frustrated with the stores and thought of this fictional-farcical tale on how a Gujju family hopes to kill their young and gorgeous competitor. When I shared this idea with Shashanka, he said he would make a film on it. When I moved to India, Shashanka had already shared the idea with Rajesh Devraj, who wrote a screenplay on it by altering it a bit. However, it didn’t really go with what I had envisioned. They put some S&M (sadomasochism) in it! I later found out that Shashanka had approached a publisher to write a book on it. Since the publisher was a common friend, she asked me why I wasn’t writing it since it was my idea. I didn’t even know that Shashanka had such plans. That’s treachery! After I wrote the book and launched it in 2010, I also heard that Anurag Basu was keen on adapting it, but since Shashanka is a friend, I was keen that he does it.” When a friend of mine told me that the film was going to be made, I wrote a comment on Shashanka’s Facebook page, ‘Wow, when were you going to tell me?’ I got no response. I wrote to producer Joy B Ganguly in March and in October, and even yesterday, after the news was reported. He replied to me saying, ‘I’m not in the business of robbing anyone else’s work, plus, this is a tabloid piece. You and Shashanka need to talk next time I’m in Mumbai. This project won’t happen before 2020...if at all.”   In the past when Manisha had reached out to Joy, he had sent a message on FB chat saying, “I was not aware of that (the fact that Shashanka’s film is based on her book)... But I believe that the initial script was written by someone called Devraj. Let me get to the bottom of this. If credit is due, it will be given... The film and script are still in the development stage... As far as I know Shashanka, he’s also not the kind of guy who would take someone’s idea and make it his own.”   When BT reached out to Shashanka, he claimed, “She (Manisha) wrote the book based on the screenplay which Rajesh Devraj and I wrote. Also, she was given the (book) rights with the understanding that she would have nothing to do with the film at the end of it.” When asked if it was originally her idea, he replied, “Actually, we came up with one line of the story when I was visiting her and her then husband. But… whatever. She also said she wanted to write the book and promised not to be involved with the film. If she has changed her stance, so be it. She was a friend then.”   Manisha categorically denied Shashanka’s claim, citing, “Neither Shashanka, nor Rajesh have lived in the US. My book is an NRI story and speaks of local Oregon laws and situations. How on earth could they have possibly thought of it! I had pitched the idea to Shashanka for the film, which he shared with Rajesh and then wrote the script. I have read their script and my book came out after that, but my book is not based on their script. It’s my idea to begin with.”',\n",

       " 'Several Noidawallahs are rejecting packaged organic products and are getting their hands dirty, quite literally! The concept of organic farming is gaining popularity in the city, with many taking land on a lease and cultivating their own organic food, which refers to produce grown without the use of any artificial supplements. Though the concept of organic farming is not new, these urban families are becoming conscious of what they eat, saying that it is the need of the hour. Organic farming as a weekend activity for Noidawallahs Nandini Diesh, a corporate lawyer and resident of Jalvayu Vihar, Sector 21, started an organic farm in Greater Noida along with five of her friends. Today, over 20 families have joined her in the quest to cultivate and eat fresh organic produce. Nandini says, “We have created a system of cooperative farming in the area where the local farmers have been taught and trained to grow vegetables, fruits and spices organically. But it doesn’t end there. All of us also have tasks to do like harvesting or adding manure, which we complete over the weekends.” Chhavi Methi, a resident of Sector 50, at an organic farm in Kheri Bhanauta village Chhavi Methi, a resident of Sector 50, at an organic farm in Kheri Bhanauta village Nandini learnt the tricks of organic farming by attending various workshops and courses over the years that helped her set up farms and also teach others. Lending a helping hand to the group, Vikrant Tongad, a green activist, came to the rescue of these families when they were unable to buy land in Noida. “I offered to lease some of my land. I belong to Greater Noida’s Khedi Bhanauta Village where I had some spare land which I decided to lease to these families,” says Vikrant. Being an environmentalist, the decision to lease his land came as an encouragement for them to take up eco-friendly initiatives. At barely 25km from their residence, the group took 4,000sqm of land at a nominal rent of Rs 12,000 per year and got started. Today, Vikrant has provided two farm lands to two families. While farming at one of them was started in 2015, ten other families started farming at the other one two months ago. Padamshree, a resident of Sector 61, at an organic farm in Kheri Bhanauta village Padamshree, a resident of Sector 61, at an organic farm in Kheri Bhanauta village ‘We treat the first batch of seeds with cow dung, cow urine, limestone and banyan tree soil’ Indu Bansal, a resident of Sector 48, says, “While doing natural farming, we use only cow-based products, neem leaves, sugar-apple and other such natural products to make pesticides and manure.” She brought together the families to the second farm that Vikrant had leased them. She adds, “I have done a few courses and attended many workshops on organic farming. Working at the farm has also taught us a lot about farming.” The farms created by the families include trees and flower plants as well. “We have around 100 fruit-bearing trees and flowering plants, so that insects like bees and butterflies come here and get the ecosystem started. Since we don’t use any artificial products, we rely heavily on such insects so that pollination begins and micro bacteria increase in the soil, which in turn helps our produce,” says Padamshree, a resident of Sector 61. Dr Gayatri Kohli, a pediatrician and resident of Sector 29, adds, “We treat the first batch of seeds with a combination of cow dung, cow urine, limestone and banyan tree soil to rid them of all chemicals. This results in 100% germination as after getting treated, it doesn’t get infested by pests and remains healthy.” Amit Dixit, a resident of Sector 137 Amit Dixit, a resident of Sector 137 ‘My kidney ailment led me to work at an organic farm in Noida’ Vedprakash Khushwaha, 35, comes from Vikaspuri in Delhi to the organic farm in Noida to work with Nandini. He suffers from a chronic kidney ailment and eating organic food was the only way left for him to survive. “The food we get in the markets is laden with urea, pesticides and nitrogen and my vital organs were unable to filter them out. I got in touch with Nandini and asked her if she could teach me how to do organic farming at my terrace. However, keeping in mind my working schedule, she suggested that I join her on weekends at their organic farm rather than grow my own,” says Vedprakash, who works at a software firm. He adds that working on the farm under fresh air is a welcome change from his daily schedule of being indoors. From organic farmers to entrepreneurs Neha Bhatia, a resident of Sector 27, started an organic farm in Sector 128 two years ago to source products for her own kitchen. “My husband owns some land in the area, which was left barren. Since I love cooking, I thought of starting an organic farm on the land,” says Neha, adding, “Looking at the great demand for organic produce in Noida, we decided to sell people produce from our farm. Today, around 200 families from Noida and Delhi buy organic products from us.” GOING ORGANIC: Indu Bansal, a resident of Sector 48 GOING ORGANIC: Indu Bansal, a resident of Sector 48 ‘From bread to cheese, everything here is organic’ The interest and curiosity about organic farming has also led to community engagements at Neha’s farm. According to her husband, having community meals made from products grown in the farm has become a weekly affair. “Families feel closer to nature when they come here and eat food cooked from organic produce. From bread and sauce to cheese and pizza, everything cooked here is organic. Once they eat it, they themselves decide whether they want the same veggies in their kitchen or not,” says Puneet Tyagi, a consultant. ‘Started organic farming in 2011 but suffered major losses’ Umesh Puri, a resident of Sector 71, suffered major losses when he first ventured into organic farming. “I started organic farming in 2011 at a small farm in Greater Noida’s Kasna village. However, it didn’t go as planned and I suffered major losses of about `30 lakh in three years as it is very difficult to sustain produce on organic farming. Now, it has all fallen into place and there are over 100 families in Noida that are using our organic produce,” says Umesh. Dr Gayatri Kohli, a pediatrician and resident of Sector 29 at an organic farm in Greater Noida Dr Gayatri Kohli, a pediatrician and resident of Sector 29 at an organic farm in Greater Noida ‘Awareness about organic farming has increased in Noida’ According to experts, the trend of organic farming has caught up in Noida in the past two to three years. “Noida is an urban centre, and people here would have knowledge about kitchen gardening and not organic farming. However, now, more people are looking to adopt organic ways to grow their own food. If they cannot rent or buy their own land, many want to convert the terraces of their homes, or balconies into mini-organic farm beds,” says Hardik Rawat, who holds workshops on organic farming in the city, adding, “Every now and then, we see videos on social media that show how poorly farming is being done in the country. There are simple hacks to check whether your food has wax on it, or has chemicals sprayed on it. Such things are making the residents more aware towards organic farming and they are losing trust in the products sold commercially. As a result, some are opting to buy directly from farms while others are choosing to dig in and start their own farms.” (L-R) Amit Dixit, Nandini Diesh and Padamshree (L-R) Amit Dixit, Nandini Diesh and Padamshree',\n",

       " 'Tirupur: The city corporation has proposed to establish 16 micro composting centres under the smart city project to dispose biodegradable waste. This is in addition to the 41 onsite composting centres that will come up in as many corporation parks and 13 more micro composting centres, which are in the pipeline. The civic body hopes all these would help it dispose of more than 216 metric tonnes (MT) biodegradable waste that is generated in the dollar city in a day. It’s a major step in the garbage disposal front in the city, where the corporation simply dumps a lion’s share of waste in abandoned stone quarries. With a population of 10 lakh, the city generates 480MT waste, of which 216MT are biodegradable waste and 264MT, non-biodegradable waste. “With these projects we are confident of disposing of the biodegradable waste safely. But it wouldn’t be possible without the cooperation of people, who should comply with the plastic ban and help us with the source segregation of waste,” said K Boopathy, city health officer. He said each micro composting centre would have a capacity to handle five tonnes biodegradable waste, which would be first pulverised before being put in 14 cubes. “Besides pouring effective microorganisms solution, the pulverised waste will be transferred from one tub to another. This process will continue for seven days and in the end, manure will be formed.” Pointing out that it would take anywhere between Rs 70 lakh and Rs 80 lakh to set up a micro composting centre, the said works on all the 16 centres were in the first phase. They will become functional in three to four months, he said. “The city corporation is also working on onsite composting centres in 41 of the 81 parks. With a capacity to handle one tonne waste, each centre will cover around 150 houses, from where sanitary workers would collect the waste and convert them into manure. Two onsite composting centres at Nanjappa garden and GN garden have already started functioning,” Boopathy said. The health officer said the manure produced would be distributed to the needy farmers free of cost as directed by the commissionerate of municipal administration. For collecting biodegradable waste from households, the civic body requires 93 light commercial vehicles and 514 battery operated vehicles. Presently, it has only 62 light commercial vehicles and 162 battery operated vehicles. The remaining is expected to be procured under the smart city project. “We have identified 144 bulk waste generators, who generate more than 120kg biodegradable waste daily, and asked them to set up either composting yards or biomethanisation plants,” the health officer said.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The sun has set, and in the dark corner of Panchkuian Road, which branches off from Connaught Place, sex workers wait for their work to begin. From the shadows a pair of eyes scans the street, but not for customers. The eyes are on the sex workers themselves. They belong to a bespectacled 62-year-old. As Khushi trudges around, a walking stick in hand, she is keenly looking out for those who might need help in seeking treatment to keep the human immunodeficiency virus at bay. On World AIDS Day on December 1, people like Khushi will not be feted. They are the anonymous troops engaged in the ground battle against the scourge. An HIV patient herself and a woman trapped in a man’s body, Khushi has only ever lived life in the margins. But undeterred, she has worked for 15 years now to check the spread of HIV by providing the sex walkers with condoms and identifying AIDS patients and persuading them to accompany her to hospitals. Born in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur, known for its eponymous switchblade, Khushi (name changed to protect her identity) experienced the horrors of bullying and taunts early in life. Her protective mother sent her to a woman doctor’s home hoping this would shelter her from the cruel world, but the 10-year-old domestic help got no respite and was sexually abused by the doctor’s son. “When I couldn’t bear it any longer, I ran away to Delhi to live with a relative hoping that a new city would give me a chance at a new life,” the ageing transgender recalls with a sigh. In the capital, she spent her days selling incense sticks on the street, doing odd jobs, vulnerable and exploited several times over. “There were days when I was so scared and shaken that I didn’t have the courage to leave my room,” she says. Then, in her late 30s, Khushi was diagnosed with HIV. Her flesh, literally, was weak, but her spirit was willing. Her treatment first in AIIMS and then in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital bore fruit and she became an HIV survivor. A meeting with RML medical counsellor Poonam Goel changed her attitude to life. Goel taught her how to recognise the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases and encouraged her to find patients of such among sex workers and bring them to hospital. This proved easier said than done. Many sex workers were unwilling to be seen in a hospital. But Goel testifies, “Khushi brought in hundreds of HIV-positive people from place like Azadpur Mandi and Jahangirpuri who had been unwilling to seek treatment fearing the disclosure of their identity. She convinced them to come to the hospital, even sometimes if in a burka.” Khushi’s biggest challenge is helping the HIV patients overcome the fear of stigma. She convinces those she meets in her mission field in Azadpur Mandi, Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, Model Town and Sindhu border by telling them that unlike her diagnosis in the early 1990s when medicines were not easily available, free treatment at government hospitals can help them live a long life. “My job doesn’t finish with helping them with the formalities,” she adds. “I keep tabs on the patients. I keep their medical cards with me so I know whether they are taking home the prescribed medicines from the hospitals in time.” On December 1, as the night falls and people retreat into their houses, Khushi steps out, knowing she has an unfinished business on the streets.',\n",

He urged all the police personnel to take part in the programme to feel relaxed. “It is a two-way communication programme where cops can share all their problems with the trainers, who will offer them solutions. Every Sunday, cops and their family members will be provided counselling,” Periaiah said. He said the programme would be conducted for one year and 1,500 cops from the district rural police would benefit from it.

The inspector general of police said there was no Naxalite movement in the western zone and the Naxalite special division police were regularly conducting combing operations in forest areas. “Our cops are maintaining a very good rapport with the tribals. If any strangers are found roaming inside the forest, the special division would get information immediately. We have been implementing a lot of welfare measures for the tribals.” Periaiah also said the accident rate has come down in Coimbatore and a few other districts in the western zone. “The best three districts will be selected in the zone and officials will be rewarded for their effort to reduce the fatal accident rate in their respective districts.” DIG Karthikeyan and district superintendent of police R Pandiarajan also addressed the rural cops.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Concerted pollution-control measures, coupled with favourable weather conditions, allowed Delhi to breathe easier — albeit slightly — in October and November this year compared with the same period in 2016 and 2017.  An analysis of October data showed an average AQI of 268.6 for 2018, a slight improvement from 284.9 in 2017 and 270.9 in 2016. However, at 334.9, the average AQI for November was a big improvement on the last two years (360.9 in 2017 and 374.06 in 2016). In November 2016, Delhi saw as many as 10 “severe” days. An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is classified as “poor” on the CPCB index; anything between 301 and 400 is “very poor”. A reading above 400 is classified as “severe” on the index that has a maximum limit of 500. The capital saw lower number of pollution spikes in October and November this year, which experts attributed largely to pre-emptive action taken by authorities. Delhi saw just one “severe” day in October in 2018 — the same as last year. However, there were three “severe” days in October 2016. And while the situation is nowhere close to ideal, November 2018 has definitely been far better: Delhi saw just five “severe” days in November 2018 compared to seven in 2017 and 10 in 2016. This, despite Diwali being celebrated in November this year, unlike the previous two years when it fell in October. “The spikes have been controlled this time. While air quality has touched ‘severe’ in November this year too, it hasn’t shot up to the same levels as in 2017 and 2018. Measures like stopping construction activity at the start of November and restriction on entry of trucks have helped keep pollution under check. These steps can be taken again, if required,” a senior CPCB official said. In November 2017, AQI had peaked at 486; it was even worse in 2016 at 497. In 2018 so far, Delhi’s highest AQI has been 426. Anumita Roychowdhury, head of the Centre for Science and Environment’s air pollution programme, said weather conditions and pre-emptive action had resulted in a cleaner winter so far. “This year, there is cleaner BS-VI fuel for vehicles. The Badarpur thermal power plant has been shut. Emergency measures initiated at the start of November have been able to shave off the peaks and resulted in the smog clearing out sooner. We have seen lower number of ‘severe days’”, Roychowdhury told TOI. She added that better implementation on the ground could have given even better results. “While these emergency measures are showing results, we need to focus on long-term action plans and their implementation,” Chowdhury said. Nevertheless, other factors, such as active western disturbances, have helped . According to a Met department official, two high pollution episodes events had brought NCR under a blanket of smog from October 28 to November 6 in 2016, and between November 7 and 14 in 2017. This time, two active disturbances have prevented any such emergency. “The worst part usually comes between October 28 and November 20. After that, fog takes over. This year, active western disturbances on November 2-4 and 14-16, have helped,” RK Jenamani, meteorological head at IGI, told TOI. According to former CPCB air laboratory chief Dipankar Saha, not only western, but also eastern-southern disturbances cause free flow of air from northwest or north. “Once the free flow is restricted, there will be a calm condition, followed by accumulation of pollutants in the air... accumulation leads to higher concentrations of pollutants. The concentration of pollutants is largely dependent on the meteorological conditions in Delhi NCR and the Indo-Gangetic plains. This is very significant in November, till January. We can’t avoid this, but we can definitely reduce, cut, prevent and control toxicity by means of reducing emissions from man-made sources,” Saha said.',\n",

The city police had earlier formed a special team led by sub-inspector Kandasamy to curb smuggling of ganja into the district from other districts within the state and the neighbouring states. According to them, ganja peddlers mainly target college students and youths in Peelamedu and surrounding areas. During a vehicle check on Codissia road on October 29, the special team found seven people smuggling 110kg ganja in a car and two motorcycles. Immediately, the team arrested all the seven - Sakthivel, 49 and his sister Eswari, 44, from Muthupatti in Madurai; Ashok, 31, from Madurai; Gokulakannan, 23, and Mohammed Rafiq, 23, from Singanallur in the city; and Dineshbabu, 23, and Praveen, 24, of Avarampalayam in the city - and seized the vehicles. They were later lodged at the Coimbatore Central Prison under the judicial custody. The Peelamedu police registered a case against the seven based on their confessional statement that they had smuggled the contraband into the city from Andhra Pradesh and they were planning to sell them to college students. Preliminary investigation revealed that three more people, identified as Sakthivel, Mujibur Rahman and Muthulakshmi, were assisting the gang to smuggle ganja into the city. The trio are, however, still at large.

       " 'Coimbatore: From now on, schools would have to shell out a certain percentage of the grant allotted to them on keeping their premises clean and hygiene - the school education department has directed them to spend 10% of the total grant to implement Swachh Action Plan (SAP) under the Swachh Bharat Mission. The remaining fund could be utilized to repair damaged infrastructure or to procure laboratory equipment. It is the first time the school education department has issued specific directions pertaining to the use of grant. It isn’t all. The schools would also have to intimate the department of the initiatives taken to utilize the grant, while the latter would monitor the same constantly, said a Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan official. According to the official, the school management could use the grant for all sort of cleanliness-related activities - to conduct awareness programmes to students, maintain and repair toilets, dispose waste properly, procure cleaning equipment and products. “the objective is to keep the school premises, including toilets, clean.” To ensure the involvement of students, each school would have a student squad to take out cleanliness drives. The squad will be formed by the school management development committee, which allots funds for various developmental activities of a school, the official said. “Both the committee members and the students will be provided training to give them a fair idea about Swachh Action Plan.” A total of Rs 38.06 crore was allotted as composite school grant to 6,058 government high and higher secondary schools across the state this year. Of this, 187 government high and higher schools in the district have received Rs 1.22 crore, compared to Rs 91.05 lakh for 183 schools last year. “The school education department has for the first time allotted funds based on the student strength of the schools. Until last year, a fixed amount was given to schools irrespective of the student strength and because this many schools remained underfunded,” the official said. Meanwhile, T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association said students were always involved in cleaning activities in schools under different programmes. “Students and teachers could clean the school campus and class rooms, but not the toilets. Toilets need maintenance on high priority as more than 80% of government schools in the district does not have sanitary workers,” he said. Instead of asking the schools to spend a part of its grant, the school education department should take steps to appoint at least one sanitary worker for two or three schools and it would surely yield better results, he said.',\n",

       " 'Skin care is important. Period. Nobody likes a sudden acne breakout just before a big meeting or a date. But by adopting a terrific (but basic) skincare ritual, that happens to be just a 5-step guide, you can up your skin health considerably. You don’t need an arsenal of products or spend a bomb; just basic skincare picks that are suitable for your skin type. Here’s where you start: Step 1: Cleanse The first thing that every guy should do in the morning (after brushing, of course), is clean his face. But remember, just a few splashes of water will not be enough to remove all the dirt and excess oil, you’ll need something more. Instead of picking up a bath soap, invest in a face cleanser based on your skin type. Use daily and remember to pat your face dry – never rub your face.   Step 2: Shaving Care How you shave will define how your skin really feels. Razor burns can cause irritation and over time, even lead to an acne breakout. Use the razor carefully and glide it smoothly by using the right shaving cream/gel. In addition, invest in a good post-shave balm (not any random moisturiser) to smooth your skin out and prevent any shaving-induced breakouts. Men too need exfoliate to get rid of dead skin cells to keep their skin looking good  Step 3: Exfoliate First off, let’s establish: exfoliation is not only for women. Men too, need to get rid of dead skin cells regularly, to keep their skin in its best health. Start with exfoliating at least once a week and try to make it a ritual. Let’s make this easier for you. To begin with, keep every Sunday as your day for exfoliating your skin with a scrub, to open your pores and remove the trapped dirt and oil. And once you’re done exfoliating, hydrate your skin with a charcoal face mask. By doing this, you will not only get rid of the excess grime, dead skin skin cells, but also leave yourself with a healthier looking and clearer skin.   Step 4: Moisturise  Now that your skin is clean, it’s time to hydrate it with a moisturiser suitable for your skin type. Choose a gel-based moisturiser, that won’t make your skin feel greasy. Brownie points if it also contains SPF (sun protection factor) of 20 or above, to give yourself all-round sun protection. If not, then invest in a good sunscreen that’s non-greasy and waterproof.   Step 5: drink water  Hydrating your skin with a moisturiser isn’t enough, you need to keep your oral intake of water high too. Drink at least 2 litres of water through the day! It will clean your skin cells from within, to give clear, flawless skin on the outside!Final words: All said and done, it’s always best to consult a dermatologist too, in case you have any skin problems or irritation. An expert will give you the best advice!   — Sanjoli Arora, Mensxp.com',\n",
       " 'Coimbatore: A city college professor has found a method to recycle aluminium scrap, which would help small plants produce graded quality ingots and with enhanced mechanical and metallurgical properties. The innovation by C Bhagyanathan, professor of mechanical engineering at Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College, involves adding certain alloying elements to aluminium to enhance characteristics. He has also devised techniques to remove pollutants from the metal. Speaking of the project, entitled technology system development of recycling of aluminium alloys for industrial applications, he said currently aluminium was recycled by melting scrap in bulk. “In this, only chemical composition could be ensured but not quality. The recycling method I have devised involves adding of alloying elements such as magnesium, manganese, zinc, chromium, boron, zirconium and strontium, which will enhance the metal’s properties.” The project also involves a technique to remove impurities such as lead, tin and iron from aluminium. “We have devised sedimentation and filtration methods to remove such impurities. We have introduced a sedimentation technique in the furnace and a filtration technique in the dye which would remove impurities from the molten metal,” he said and added that the technique involves filters. By following this method, even small plants could produce high quality aluminium, which could be used to produce ingots – blocks of metal used in casting process – Bhagyanathan, who is the principal investigator of the project, said. Small plants use electric induction furnaces, LPG furnace or coal furnace. “By adopting this method, small plants could produce high quality ingots with existing infrastructure.” Presently, ingots are mostly produced only by large plants and other firms which produce aluminium products depend on them for ingots. Not only quality, the method also ensures that the cost is reduced, Bhagyanathan said. Pointing out that now aluminium was sold for 260 per kg, he said the method would bring the cost down to an estimated 180 per kg. The project was undertaken at Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College through the Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) programme under technologies development and transfer division (TDTD) of the department of science and technology. For the project, a centre for aluminium recycling was set up at the college at a cost of 1.18crore. Along with Bhagyanathan, researchers from CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Trivandurum, are also involved in the project. Two firms have already come forward to adopt the technology, Bhagyanathan said.',\n",
       " 'The declining work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) in the tribal districts of Dungarpur and Banwara has intensified the migration, leaving several villages without a male population. These districts have completed a full circle after limiting migration for 10 years, especially women and children, to again witness a high trend. Social activist says that migration of this level does not bode well for a society as it uproots families, increases dropouts in schools, raises health risks and exposes them to harassment. The number of families under MGNREGA fell to 2,38,925 in 2018 from 2,49,306 in 2016 in Dungarpur. What is more disturbing is that the number of families which were given employment of 100 days and above was 1409 in 2018 against 46,198 in 2016. Explaining the adverse effects, Kamal Tak of SR Abhiyan says, “The 100 days of minimum work is also not enough to meet their livelihood needs for the whole year but has prevented a mass migration to urban areas.” Villages are the worst affected. Mahendra Barjod, a Pradhan of Chikli Panchyat Samiti in Dungarpur says that his village has either youths under 10 years or elders above 50 years of age. “The rest are engaged in menial jobs at Gujarat, Udaipur, Chittorgarh and bordering districts of MP. The age imbalance makes the families vulnerable for harassment of several kinds. Repeatedly, it has been apprised to the district collector to start the MGNREGA work but in vain,” said Singh Jayesh Joshi, a social activist working in tribal areas. He said that the aftereffects of the migration will be visible in the coming years. “The migrant workers are engaged in low paid jobs, mostly in unorganized sector. They don’t make great savings as they send money home after keeping a small amount for their basic expenses. Due to migration they missed out on several social welfare schemes which could have provided them sources of livelihood here,” said Joshi. The local administration admits the problem but didn’t suggest any corrective measure to contain migration. Both BJP and Congress are aware of problem but they are shying away for making any promise of giving MGNREGA work in the region.',\n",
       " 'Coimbatore: Despite mounting pressure from farmers who has been seeking respite from two rogue elephants in Thadagam valley, the forest department is in no hurry to capture the elephants as it had a bitter experience in the past. The department is to seek opinion from farmers, wildlife activists and experts on the issue before taking a final call. During a grievance meeting in the city on Friday, a group of farmers raised their demand of translocating the elephants – Chinna Thambi and Vinayaka – as the damage caused by them continue despite deploying four kumkis to drive them deep into the forests. The farmers demanded a solution both from district collector TN Hariharan and district forest officer (DFO) D Venkatesh. After consulting with his superiors, the DFO asked the farmers to participate in a meeting at his office on Sunday to share their opinions on this issue with officials from the forest department and veterinary doctors. The forest department has assured to take a final call within a week after the meeting, announced the district collector which made the farmers to disperse with hope. “The district collector had written to chief wildlife warden TP Ragunath requesting him to grant permission to translocate the elephants. He had also assured that the elephant menace would be solved by November 25, but nothing has changed. In the last four months, the death toll has increased to seven in the region,” district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam P Kandasamy said. “Why does the department remain silent when the death toll and damage caused by the elephants are increasing every other day,” he questioned. The department is afraid to answer wildlife activists and NGOs if some untoward incidents takes place while translocating the elephants, he said. “For one last time, we believe the words of officials. If no action was taken, then we will act differently,” he warned. “The department has been taking actions to control the damage caused by the wild elephants. The chief wildlife warden has granted permission to translocate the elephant, as well. But, we do not want to act in hurry. We have sought opinion from farmers, wildlife activists and experts,” chief conservator of forest (CCF) of Coimbatore circle Deepak Srivastava said. “In 2017, when the department was translocating a wild elephant, Madukkarai Maharajan, it died. We do not want a similar situation to arise,” he said. Meanwhile, he has sought a report pertaining to the damage caused by the elephants after the deployment of kumkis to access the behavior of the elephants.

       " 'Coimbatore: Only a negligible percentage of brides from tribal community in the district have benefitted from the state government’s marrisage assistance scheme. Of the total number of beneficiaries who had availed the scheme – assistance fund and gold for marriage – in the last two years in the district, only 0.1% of brides belong to tribal community, according to the data received from the social welfare department, which is implementing the scheme. Tribal population in Coimbatore is 28,342 as per 2011 census. The state government provides 8gm of gold and Rs 50,000 for brides belonging to below poverty line and holding a degree certificate. Similarly, it provides 8gm of gold and Rs 25,000 for brides who had passed Class X. In case of tribes, Class V is considered as minimum qualification to receive the assistance. In the financial year 2017-18, 4,331 brides had benefitted from the scheme. Of this, only seven – three under graduate category and four under Class X category – were from tribal community. Similarly, for the financial year 2018-19, the department has received 3,000 applications from new brides and of which only four – one under graduate category and three under Class X category – were from tribal community. While the number of applications from SC community has increased from 307 to 372 i.e., from 7% to 12% of the total beneficiaries from last year, the ST beneficiaries have come down, said an official from the department. “The applicants should register in the website at least a day before their marriage. With no e-seva centre around their settlements, the tribals will have to travel over 10km to the centres to register. Due to poor transportation facilities and in the marriage busy, the applicants fail to meet the deadline,” said one of the coordinators of the scheme on condition of anonymity. “We have to travel multiple times to several government departments like the offices of village administrate officer (VAO) and tahsildar to get income certificate,” said a 30-year-old beneficiary from Karamadai, who had struggled to get the assistance. The stretch from Karamadai to Pillur is in bad shape and bus facilities are also limited. “Instead of running from pillar to post for several days during the marriage time, it is convenient for us to let it go,” she said, adding that they are aware of the scheme, but it is out of reach for them. Refuting the allegations, the official said, “We have appointed a coordinator for every block to identify and assist the applicants. We have created enough awareness among the people. The beneficiaries from tribal community are negligible because the number of eligible candidates is less.” Acknowledging that the eligible candidates are less in hill tribal settlements, district president of Tamil Nadu Tribal People’s Association VS Paramasivam said there are several tribal settlements, like in Annaimalai block, which are not connected by road and the residents walk for several kilometers to catch a bus to reach schools or workplace. “How will a less than 10-year-old girl walk on her own to the school as her parents would have gone for work early in the morning. The children do not even get the facilities like free transportation from school education department,” he said. Even those who have availed the scheme would have been from plain tribal settlements as it is easy for the officials to reach and assist them, he added.',\n",
       " 'It was for the first time in 2013 that BJP had managed to sweep the tribal districts of Banswara and Dungarpur, traditionally believed to be a Congress bastion. The nine assembly seats, all reserved for scheduled tribes, unanimously voted for BJP. Five years down the line, they feel cheated. Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, during his second tenure from 2008 to 2013, had paid much attention to the district. A strong representation ensured that Banswara’s demand for a railway line, a national highway and power plants were accepted. He even had work initiated during his tenure. However, BJP, which rode to power on the promise that these would be completed, put everything on hold. The tribals were left dejected and anguished. The projects were expected to change the fate and face of the two districts, bringing in development and the much-needed jobs for the local youth, who have only recently become aware of the benefits of education. There are other issues too. BJP failed to develop the infrastructure at the Govind Guru Tribal University (GGTU), Banswara, which is yet another Congress-government’s project. According to locals, the ruling party deliberately chose to ignore. Additionally, the BJP government failed to initiate repair work of the Mahi canal, which is considered as the life-line of Banswara, budget allocations for which were made almost every year. The district hospitals here do not have doctors and there is a serious need to push the education sector. It was probably because of chief minister Vasundhara Raje, August 9 was declared a holiday in the two districts to mark the World Tribal Day. She also announced to waive off co-operative loans of small and marginal farmers in the tribal sub-plan areas (TSP), which covered both Banswara and Dungarpur. However, many believe that it was a case of too late and two little. But trouble is brewing in the tribal belt now with sections of local youth gathering to demand a separate ‘Bhil Mina state’. The group under the banner of Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) for the first time has fielded candidates on three of the five assembly seats of Banswara and on all the four seats of Dungarpur, which too has complaints of neglect. The ruling party, to fight anti-incumbency, has dropped two senior leaders – Jeetmal Khant and Dhan Singh Rawat, who was a state minister and the incumbent MLA from Ghatol Navneet Lal. It has also replaced two of the sitting MLAs from Dungarpur.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Guidelines of Delhi government’s directorate of education that private schools in the city cannot raise fees without its say so has led a prominent south Delhi school to request parents to pay the “proposed” higher fees on “a provisional basis”. If this is not done, says the letter sent by the school to the parents on Wednesday, the woeful state of finances could lead to the institution’s “unceremonious closure”. “It was noted that on compliance of the DoE order, the school would be in enormous deficit, even if the basis of calculations of DoE, which though contrary to the Rule position, is accepted. This huge deficit might even lead to the unceremonious closure of the school known for imparting qualitative education for over six decades,” said the letter sent by Bluebells School International, East of Kailash. The school had planned to hike the fees to meet the burden of implementing the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, but on August 1, DoE rejected the proposal after carrying out an audit. However, Bluebells claimed that DoE made an erroneous calculation of the institution’s finances and the facts and figures submitted with documentary evidence were not acknowledged. “DoE had been apprised of the adverse effects of the order. However, the request has yet not yielded any result,” the letter to parents stated. The school, which is sited on government land, maintained that the implementation of the pay commission pay scales in 2017-18, as per DoE’s directives, had resulted in “enormous additional” financial burden. “Hence, charging the fee on the basis of 2016-17, as per the (August) order, would make it impossible to pay salaries to the staff members, leave aside the payment of balance of arrears... and meeting other essential expenses in 2018-19.” Bluebells has moved Delhi high court on DoE’s order, maintaining that it does not need government permission to raise school fees. But with DoE yet to give the court its reply, there has been no relief on the front. In the interim, the institution wants the parents to pay their dues as per the provisional fee bills sent to them. “The school has no other option but to issue fee bill on provisional basis for the ensuing quarters, i.e. October 2018 onwards,” Wednesday’s letter said. Principal Sumar Kumar told TOI, “The school stands by its assurance that the final judicial decision of the authorities or the honourable court will be adhered to. It is always open to discussions with the parents, but it will be impossible to manage at the earlier fees.” The letter has stumped parents. “The government should intervene to sort out the confusion. Even if we pay the fees, we do not know whether the school will refund the money if the court disagrees with the school,” remarked the father of a Class V student.',\n",

       " 'Madurai: A lush-green campus with over 2,500 trees including a variety of fruit-bearing ones, kitchen and herbal gardens, beautifully maintained lawns and wards with FM radio and television. That is the Government Hospital for Thoracic Medicine at Thoppur for you. No wonder then that the hospital walked away with the award for the best government hospital at a function in Chennai on Tuesday. Established on February 12, 1960 by former chief minister Kamarajar to treat people tuberculosis patients and those with other infectious diseases, the hospital was once popularly known as the ``Kattaspathiri’’ (jungle hospital). Its dilapidated buildings among overgrown bushes and trees were an eyesore and considered a place where government doctors could be posted as punishment. Situated on a sprawling 100-acre campus, near the proposed site of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, its condition was anything but shocking when he joined in 2013, says its resident medical officer, Dr S Gandhimathinathan, the man behind the change. Today, a visit to the 285-bedded hospital will leave even local people spellbound as it now boasts a transformation that is hard to believe with facilities and an environment which could give private hospitals a run for their money. A radiologist by profession, Dr Gandhimathinathan is widely regarded as the man behind the hospital’s change. The greenery is accentuated by over 2,500 trees most of which are five years old, a beautiful kitchen garden which provides vegetables for the patients, a herbal garden and a patch of fruit trees which have started bearing exotic fruits like jambu (syzygium samarangense), mangoes and gauvas. Impeccably-maintained lawns are kept clean by workers, music plays softy through the speakers based on the preference of the patients in the gardens while all the wards and rooms have FM radios and televisions. To top it all, the patients and their attenders can view an old movie of their choice on the big screen in one of the halls twice a week. Pure water is provided through an RO plant of 20 litres capacity and there are inverters in all the wards. The library is also soughtafter by the patients. With a room for meditation and yoga, the attenders of patients some of whom may stay on for months have the facility to learn sewing on the machines in the hospital. A new addition has been the beehives with a hospital employee ready to teach bee rearing to anyone. They had collected 1.5 litres of pure honey a few days ago. The bees are also helping in the pollination of the trees, says John, a hospital staffer. Pulmonologist Dr Jaiganesh says that the environment with good air is an advantage for patients with lung diseases. Commenting on the award, health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan said that Dr Gandhimathinathan has set an example on how a government doctor could transform a facility through commitment with the available resources surpassing the private sector. His man management skills and commitment to patients were an inspiration to many others, he added. Vox Pop: L Selvaraj, former patient from Nilakottai, “I was treated for eight months here and now I have chosen to work here, cleaning and painting which is very satisfying,’’. S Valliamma, patient from Sellur, ``I have been treated in other hospitals, but I enjoy staying here because the care, food and the environment are good and clean,’. M Maheswari, staff nurse with the hospital for a decade, ``Ten years ago, power was a problem here and we were dependent on torches for light in the night, and used to tread cautiously along the bushy path,’’.',\n",

       " 'CHANDIGARH: Even after lapse of extended deadline set by the Punjab government for contractual teachers to submit their option — whether they want to regularise their jobs or continue working with different societies — nearly 3,900 of them have failed to pick either. The government had asked 8,886 teachers under Sarv Sikhya Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and other societies to submit their choice by midnight of November 30. Till 7pm, 4,586 had opted for regularisation of service, while around 3,900 had not made any choice. Only eight teachers have opted to stay back in the societies. Of total 8,886, the department had regularised around 400 teachers in July. Punjab Teacher and Education Welfare Association stated that a large number of teachers could not make a choice as they were confused and requested the government to give them another chance for making a choice. President of the association Sanjay Kumar said that they had submitted a memorandum to the education secretary with request to extend the deadline. “A lot of teachers failed to make a choice due to false propaganda regarding terms and condition of regularisation,” said the teacher, who has also opted for regularisation. The state government on October 9, issued a notification in compliance with the decision taken by the cabinet on October 3, that the teachers working in Centre-sponsored schemes SSA, RMSA would be regularised. The teachers would be paid a monthly salary of Rs 15,300 during the probation period of three years, starting from April 1. At present, the contractual teachers are being paid Rs 42,800 per month. Punjab education minister O P Soni said another chance would be given to teachers who failed to make any choice. “For benefit of contractual teachers, who could not make any choice for any reasons, will be given more time,” said Soni. The government had first set October 23 as the deadline, but later extended the last date till November 30 after lukewarm response. Teacher unions under the Sanjha Morcha are up in arms against the government for terms and conditions framed for regularisation. Convenor of the morcha Sukhwinder Chahal accused the government of using pressure tactics for making the teachers opt for regularisation. “They used every trick in the book to force teachers,” alleged Chahal. He said that they would stage a massive protest in Patiala on December 2.

I decided that I would start with cleaning up. Q: Transforming a government hospital is easier said than done. What else helped you in the process?

The civic body issued the warrant of distress, which is in possession of TOI, to the executive engineer of north building division under Section 156A of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The deputy assessor and collector of north corporation said that no satisfactory cause for non-payment of Rs 6.01 crore has been shown by PWD. The amount is due from 2004-05, when the unit area method of property tax assessment was introduced, till the current financial year. “This sum is leviable under sections 114 and 119 of DMC Act. This pending amount is for the land and buildings at Gulabi Bagh and Sindhora Halan,” the official said. Earlier, a 30-day notice had been issued to PWD. “We have attached the SBI accounts of PWD at Tis Hazari and requested the agency to pay the due amount to the north DMC commissioner. Once the account is attached, the bank gives time to the agency to respond or deposit the money, failing which the amount is deducted and transferred to the civic body,” the official said.

Project director of Seismic Hazard Risk Assessment (SHRA), ministry of earth sciences, Dr OP Mishra said, “We have selected 30 cities as part of first phase for the study. In Tamil Nadu, we have selected Chennai and Coimbatore for the study.” The cities were selected as per ministry’s earthquake-prone areas. “We are going to conduct soil tests at various places in the city to make microzonation. Each area has different types of soil. After the tests, we would suggest the government for the design of new building codes. Based on the codes, buildings should be constructed in respective microzonation areas to withstand earthquakes,” Dr Mishra said.

Only the sales are undertaken here while the cooking is done in a small room a few feet away. Their masala vada is made of a mixture of dhals, chilli, salt, asafoetida and fried in oil. ``The taste is unique, which is why many of the big shops source their vadas from us, ‘’ said Kannan. Ask what the secret is and the couple say they never compromise on quality of the ingredients. “We grind just enough to meet the demand and never make vada from dough left over,” he said. The vadas are so tasty that customers do not even complain that they are not offered the customary chutney to go with it. ``Since this is a busy street, if we offer chutney, people will throw the paper around and wash their hands in the street, making it dirty and muddy. So we stopped providing chutney and nobody complains,’’ said Shanthi. The shop sees hundreds of people turning up to buy a couple of vadas to go with their variety lunch. ``These vadas are so tasty they can be had as snack or rice-puller,’’ said S Somu, who has been a regular customer for the past 20 years. They sell about five hundred vadas a day at Rs 6 each. ———————- Where is it – at the corner of Mela Chetty street and Thottiyankinaru street What is famous: Masala vada, appam Price – Rs 6 each Time – 5 AM to 3 PM',\n",

Tanwar met Gandhi and All-India Congress Committee general secretary P C Chako on Friday, to press the case of contesting civic polls on the party symbol. Sources said Gandhi ruled out the possibility of reviewing the decision after an hour of discussion. Speaking to TOI, Tanwar expressed inability to divulge details of the meeting. He, however, maintained that he took the case up with Gandhi. “We will keep pushing for the case; this is a matter of people’s sentiments,’’ he said. In a release issued in the evening, Tanwar said he was hopeful of a positive decision on the issue and announced that he would meet Gandhi again, before the filing of nominations starts. Five muncipal corporations and two municipal councils in the state are going to polls on December 16. Congress has been divided on the matter. The Haryana Congress faction led by ex-CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said participation in the elections would be a waste of resources. It is of the view that the party should support independent candidates with a clean image. Claiming that the Congress was riding an anti-incumbency wave in the state, Tanwar has “strongly supported” contesting the elections on the party symbol. Tanwar had on Monday addressed 27 meetings in Karnal and urged locals to support Congress candidates. This was followed by a meeting of the All India Congress Committee on Thursday, where the panel headed by Chako rejected the proposal of contesting elections of the party symbol.',\n",

The digital seismograph was installed at the Salem collectorate in 2013. In the event of an earthquake, the possibility of recording it now is nil. The Coimbatore district administration has long been seeking a digital seismograph to be installed in its new building. In 1900, a minor earthquake was reported in Coimbatore with a magnitude of 6 in Richter scale. Authorities from the Coimbatore disaster management department were also demanding for a seismograph in the city. India Meteorological Department (IMD) is the nodal agency for monitoring seismic activity nationwide. It maintains a seismological network comprising 82 seismological observatories. In Tamil Nadu, three seismological observatories are functioning from Chennai, Kodaikanal and Salem. A seismograph was installed inside the district collectorate in Salem in 1999. The IMD replaced it with a digital seismograph in 2013. An officer from the IMD said, “If any earthquake with the reading of four in Richter scale is reported in Coimbatore, there is no possibility to record it at the seismological observatories located in Salem, Chennai and Kodaikanal. It could be recorded in the observatories only when it is above 4 in the Richter scale. Moreover, it would take 5 to 7 minutes to complete the recording process in the observatories. If a seismograph is installed at the district collectorate in Coimbatore, it could be recorded within a minute.” He said the digital seismograph in Salem had recorded earlier earthquakes in Andaman, Gujarat and northeast. Now, the IMD can monitor the digital seismographs from New Delhi with the help of V-Sat based digital seismic telemetry system. Three weeks ago, the Coimbatore district administration has sent a proposal to the commissioner of revenue administration (CRA) to allot an advanced digital seismograph for Coimbatore district collectorate.',\n",

Students also joined in the protest. Among the marchers were women who carried photos of farmer husbands who had committed suicide and daughters of similarly deceased fathers. The march which began at 10.15am and reached Parliament Street around 11.45pm past the Ranjeet Singh Flyover caused huge traffic snarls that affected thousands of commuters in central Delhi during the peak morning hours. Some protesters distributed pamphlets explaining their problems and apologising to the commuters for road congestion. The farmers’ groups carried flags in red, yellow and green, whose bright colours could not hide the anguish of emotional women who had lost the family breadwinners due to agrarian distress. A group of women from Telangana, whose husbands had killed themselves, could not express their sadness through words, but their melancholy eyes were expressive enough. “The debate in the country is about Ram and Hanuman when it should be about the problems of the people who feed the country,” rued Shanti Devi, a farmers’ leader from Madhya Pradesh. Abhijit Ray, a teenager from Purulia in West Bengal, was more pugnacious when he said, “City people don’t think about our problems even though they cannot survive if farmers stop producing food grains.” The farmers, who raised slogans against PM Narendra Modi and the BJP-led central government, were led by Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, activist Medha Patkar and farmer leaders. Many students, including a large number from Delhi University, also raised slogans in support of the farmers at the march held under the banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. Many of the protesters from across India carried banners written in their own languages to assert their regional identity and flag the problems of the farmers of their states.

Jain expressed amusement at the Centre’s approval to CBI and enforcement directorate to prosecute him for allegedly buying land near unauthorised colonies with laundered money. In the past three years, the department headed by Jain has spent over Rs 2,500 crore on construction of roads, sewer lines and drains in 650 unauthorised colonies, Delhi government said. AAP has alleged that the prosecution sanction was given because its government has made efforts to regularise such colonies. “Modiji (PM Narendra Modi) wants to raze unauthorised colonies and render the poor homeless. I am being hounded for the scheme on regularisation of unauthorised colonies. I accept the Modi government’s charge that I am working round the clock for regularisation and providing better living conditions in unauthorised colonies. It’s my duty to provide the residents with basic facilities like roads and drains,” Jain said in a statement. Jain added, “How will I become richer by regularising the colonies? Regularisation will not benefit me but the huge number of people residing in them. This is their democratic right. Their lives will improve and they will be happier. Such vindictive action of the Modi government gives me more strength to work towards the upliftment of people living in these colonies.” Echoing the statement made by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, Delhi government said, “For decades, no one cared about the residents of unauthorised colonies.

The CM and urban development minister personally monitor the development work going on in these colonies to ensure quality,” the government said. The AAP government added that the Modi government is afraid of huge political losses due to the upliftment of people through development works in these colonies. “This is why the minister is being targeted.

Sensational kidnappings, contract killings and gang wars involving crime lords from not only the capital but even other states had become a menace for people even as the police force looked on helplessly. A young IPS officer, however, changed the rules of the game. Shortly after Deepak Mishra took charge of one of the crime-prone districts, cases were cracked in no time and victims of kidnappings rescued safely. Many cops who later went on to become encounter specialists cut their teeth under this daredevil officer. On Friday, Mishra, a 1984-batch officer — known as Super Cop in Delhi Police — retired from service. He was currently on deputation in CRPF as special director general. Mishra was brought in as the chief of law and order in January 2013, a month after the sensational Nirbhaya incident rocked the capital. “That was a critical time for the force as its credibility was at stake. However, Mishra didn’t disappoint and brought down the crime rate,” said an officer. It was Mishra who had ordered “free registration” of crime, particularly crimes against women, that were to be lodged with no questions asked. During his three-year tenure, the morale of the force was at an all-time high and they again began to retaliate at criminals with their guns — something that had been done away with after the Batla House controversy. His colleagues said that Mishra was one of the rare officers whose doors were always open for the public. “An old man once literally barged in cursing the force for not acting on a land shark in his area. Mishra asked the guards to let him go and offered him a chair. After listening to him, he directed the area SHO to leave everything and sort out the issue,” recalled an officer. The officer is also credited with encouraging the use of non-lethal weapons in the force. During the demonstration of a Taser gun, Mishra, who was then 56, rose from among the hesitant cops to test its impact. Post retirement, Mishra, an avid art collector and a music lover, plans to spend time with his family and pursuing his hobbies.',\n",

The Delhi hospital, however, claims a non-invasive procedure was carried out instead of the suggested surgery and the decision was taken at the last minute by the doctor in-charge “in the best interest of the patient”. Vinod Jain’s ordeal began in October this year when he suffered acute stomach pain and an ultrasound at Kailash hospital in Noida revealed that he had a stone in his right kidney, measuring 12.5 mm. However, the 56-year-old resident of Sector 55 went to Sant Parmanand Hospital in Delhi’s Civil Lines for a second opinion. According to Jain, Dr Tara Chand Sharma, the hospital’s urologist suggested PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy or stone extraction) procedure for the removal of the stone. “On October 25, I underwent a surgical procedure at the hospital. The procedure was over in about seven minutes and I was told that the surgery was successful and they discharged me on October 26,” he said. However, Jain’s condition deteriorated the very wnext day. His family members rushed him to Kailash hospital again, where doctors conducted another ultrasound and other tests “and told me that the stone was still present in my body”. In fact, in the ultrasound report, dated October 29, it was been found that the stone had disintegrated into two parts in the lower calyx of his right kidney, measuring 9.2 mm and 4.3 mm respectively. A month later, he underwent another surgery to remove the stones at Kailash hospital.

The forest department claims that physically relocating the animals is not an option but YEIDA has to take care to ensure smooth migration of the animals from the project site to other areas during construction of the airport at Jewar. “Physically shifting of animals to another place is not possible because species like blackbucks are so delicate they may just die in the process. However, we think that the animals would migrate to other areas in the vicinity in search of food and safety once the airport project work starts,” PK Srivastava, district forest officer (DFO), Gautam Budh Nagar, told TOI. “Our letter to YEIDA intends to raise awareness among officials about the presence of wildlife in the area so as to ensure they are not affected by the development work even as they seek a new habitat,” he added.

SP (city) Shlok Kumar said the two had consumed sulphas, a poisonous substance, in their room in Shubham Hotel near Ghaziabad railway station where they had checked in around 1.30am on Friday. The girl’s parents have accused the youth’s family of demanding a hefty dowry and later calling off the marriage when they could not meet their demands. Subodh’s family has denied the allegation.

The girl’s mother said Pooja and Subodh had most probably got married in a temple. “I found vermillion on her head. They would have been alive today, had Subodh’s parents not rejected their match.”',\n",

       " 'GHAZIABAD: In an effort to bring transparency and accountability in its functioning, the Ghaziabad Development Authority has decided to introduce a single-window system to accept complaints from the general public. The system is also aimed at reducing the interface between the public and the clerical staff of GDA to the bare minimum. According to sources, a new software is being introduced in the GDA office which will help the public to get their work done without going from one department to another, often preceded by endless follow-ups. The single-window system will admit the public grievances under four heads—property, engineering, enforcement and miscellaneous. “Counters have been opened at the reception wherein the public, as per their nature of work, shall approach the respective counter and get their work listed in the system which will then be forwarded to the respective department,” said Kanchan Verma, vice-chairperson, GDA. “Each work generated in the system has been assigned a time period under which the concerned department will have to wrap up the work. The progress of the work will be directly monitored by the vice-chairperson, secretary and chief engineer and any inordinate delay will invite an explanation from the concerned department or desk. Action will be taken in case of unsatisfactory reply,” added Verma. The time assigned to the nature of work ranges from three days to 60 working days. “Engineering work or the work related to complaints such as a non-functional streetlight or open sewer etc. have been allotted three days time while work related to map approval and similar things have been given a maximum of 60 days’ time,” added Verma. The work progress could be tracked by complainant even without visiting the GDA office.',\n",
       " 'GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has levied a Rs 1 lakh fine on the owner of a PG accommodation for dumping garbage in Sector Alfa 2 of Greater Noida. The violator has been asked to pay the fine within a week, failing which action will be taken against him. On Thursday, a morning walker, Harendra Bhati, spotted a man emptying a sack of garbage on a pavement in Sector Alfa 2. “He stopped his scooter and started emptying the sack on the pavement,” Bhati said. He said some strays started hovering around the garbage and the entire area was stinking. The man apparently told Bhati he worked for a nearby PG accommodation. “I had collected garbage from the PG and decided to dump it here. I had no idea this was a violation of green norms,” Bhati quoted the man as telling him. Bhati recorded the incident on his phone and shared it with GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan. The CEO directed officials to take action on the matter. BP Singh, in-charge of the health department at GNIDA, said a team inspected the spot and found garbage littered around. “This is a violation of the National Green Tribunal’s guidelines. The PG owner, Deepak Kumar Arya, has been fined Rs 1 lakh. His land lease deed may be cancelled if he does not comply,” he said. GNIDA officials said teams had been conducting enforcement drives in different sectors to ensure proper garbage collection and sanitation. Residents have been urged to help the door-to-door collection system.',\n",
       " 'NOIDA: The number of traffic challans issued in Noida until November this year has seen an almost five times rise from 1.2 lakh in the corresponding period last year, riding on speeding and wrong-side driving.  The traffic police have, however, attributed the rise to the e-challan system and installation of cameras and speed devices on expressways that have made it almost impossible for violators to escape without being tracked down. While 1.24 lakh challans were issued in total in the first 11 months of last year, the corresponding period this year saw almost 5.4 lakh cases. The reasons for being fined have also seen a change. Riding without helmets topped the list last year, while this year, it has been speeding and wrong-side driving. The traffic police have issued over 1.7 lakh challans for speeding this year, up from only 14,452 last year — an almost 12 time rise. Similarly, wrong-side driving has attracted as many as 74,510 challans this year as against only 6,467 last year. The figures reveal the ground situation on the roads. In neighbouring Delhi, 3.4 lakh people were fined for driving on the wrong side since January this year. Sources in the traffic police said the whopping rise in the number of challans and fines would act as a deterrent for violators in Noida and Greater Noida, who feel free to press the accelerator and take the wrong lane to save a few minutes. Over the past few months, cameras have been installed along all highways in the district —Yamuna Expressway, Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and the elevated road. Assistant traffic inspector Avinash Saini pointed out that tracking down violators was much easier now with the e-challan system, where constables are equipped with mobile phones and an app that enable them to fine violators on the spot. According to traffic inspector Anil Pandey, only the Jewar toll plaza had the automated challan system earlier and three of four traffic constables would be posted at specific junctions to fine offenders physically. Moreover, violations captured in the Highway Traffic Management System installed in May this year were also held up because of problems such as non-functioning of printers and lack of cartilage. Experts termed this an “invisible enforcement” and called for an increase in ground work for a better impact and control on violations. Anurag Kulshreshtha, president of TRAX, a society that works for road safety issues, said: “On the elevated road, where the signs say that the maximum speed limit is 50kmph, challans are being issued for driving at 70kmph. People are getting to know about the challans only when they get a copy and a picture by post. At times, they get confused with the number of challans they get. This is the easiest way, but to have an impact, there needs to be more work on the ground.” In Ghaziabad, the difference was not that stark. The traffic coops in the city have issued 1.32 lakh challans between April and November this year and collected Rs 2.10 crore in fines. This figure is marginally higher than previous year, which saw 1.31 lakh challans and Rs 2.01 crore in fines.',\n",
       " 'NOIDA: Jewellery worth Rs 10 lakh was stolen from a flat in Amrapali Silicon City in Sector 76 where its 87 guards have struck work over delay in salaries. The theft, allegedly by a labourer working in the society, took place around 2.30pm when both the occupants of the flat — Arjun Singh and his wife Garima — were away at work. Apart from the jewellery, the burglar also took Rs 16,000 in cash. Police said the flat, situated on the 15th floor of Tower Q, belongs to Singh, who works with a hotel of Gurgaon. His wife Garima (29) works with a private company in Sector 61. “The burglar entered the flat after breaking the bathroom window glass through the service shaft. He might have got in there from the staircase window,” he said. “When Garima returned from office around 5.30pm, she opened the door and found the rooms rummaged. The burglar took away both ornaments and cash,” Singh added. Although there are more than 90 cameras installed in the housing society, there is none on the 15th floor, where Singh’s flat is located. But in footage from a camera installed by a resident on the 14th floor, a “suspicious” man can be seen getting up the stairs. “We have handed over the footage to police,” Singh said. The guards of the housing society have been on a strike for the past few days. “At the time of theft, guards were on a strike due to a delay in their salary. The guards have not been paid for the last few months. So, they have not been keeping track of who is entering the society and exiting it,” a police officer said. Circle officer Swetabh Pandey said a complaint had been registered against unknown persons. Police are scanning the CCTV footage in which the suspect can be seen riding up the stairs. “The accused could have been a labourer in the society. But police are investigating the matter from all angles,” Pandey said. The residents of the housing society said guards had been going on strike frequently over non-payment of fees. As part of the housing society is under construction, it does not have a maintenance committee of its own. Neeraj Mishra, a resident, said security was lax at the housing society because of repeated protests by the guards. “Whenever they go on a protest, the society does not have any security whatsoever,” he said. “At present, there is no one to check who is entering the society and who is exiting it. The guards do not even maintain a proper register,” Mishra added.',\n",

In a press conference in Dadri on Friday, local functionaries of the party also said they would hold a protest outside Dadri police station on December 4 against the alleged police excess. Citing a recent case, they said the cops detained two scrap dealers — Irfan and Aashik — from Rampur market in Dadri. The two were later framed in fake robbery cases along with three other men. Their families alleged that they were asked to pay Rs 1 lakh to release the two. Zulfikar Malik, a relative of the two accused, told TOI that Irfan (33) and Aashik (24) are original residents of Sikandrabad area of Bulandshahr. They worked as scrap dealers at Sanjay Bhati’s shop in Rampur market in Dadri. “Chowki in-charge Vikas Charan had taken the wo men with him on November 12 to get the scrap cleared from the chowki. However, later their family was told that the duo was detained. The police also demanded Rs 1 lakh as bribe for their release which was not paid. That is why the two were framed in a fake encounter two days after their detention,” said Malik. Earlier on November 14, the police had claimed that Irfan and Aashik were arrested with two others named Shahid and Javed after an encounter near Dadri toll plaza. “Cops are illegally framing the youths in the area to score points in their department. However, the crime rate has shown no reduction and people are getting robbed every day. A complaint on this matter was given to the SSP office by the family to which the SSP himself had assured an inquiry. However, it was not done,” said Rajkumar Bhati, a spokesperson for Samajwadi Party. SSP Ajay Pal Sharma said the allegations, if substantiated, would be investigated and action would be taken. In November, a total of 23 encounters were reported in Noida and Greater Noida in which 59 alleged criminals were arrested. At least 21 of them had received bullet injuries while 38 were nabbed without injuries.',\n",

The listed items of the House business — like question hour, zero hour and call attention motions — were washed away as the opposition comprising the RJD, Congress and CPI(ML) members disrupted the proceedings while pressing for their adjournment notices. “The opposition thought the CM will give the government’s replies to various burning issues, but he did not attend the sittings, except on the first day,” Tejashwi said. “He has no interest in the development of the state, nor in controlling the deteriorating law and order situation and ensuring protection of people.

       " 'Bihar’s first mega food park is set to become operational in Khagaria soon. “It will generate employment opportunities for 2,500-3,000 skilled and semi-skilled people and about 80% of the workforce will be hired locally,” Amit Kumar, director of the Pristine Logistics and Infraprojects Pvt Ltd, tells TOI’s Anuja Shanker. Excerpts: Q1. What is a food park? A food park is a cluster-based food-processing industrial infrastructure project. It is implemented by a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) which develops the infrastructure and offers it to prospective processing units on user-charge basis. The park will essentially become operational through third-party food processing investor units who will come and populate it. Q2. What prompted you to open a food park in a remote corner of Bihar? We, the promoters, are bureaucrats-turned-entrepreneurs belonging to Bihar. The food processing sector in the state has tremendous potential, but has been suffering for decades due to lack of adequate modern infrastructure. Being sons of the soil, we were aware of the complexities and challenges of working in Bihar. However, we were not deterred because we did not intend to do this project in our home state for money. Q3. What sort of challenges did you face? Didn’t the Centre and the state government help? The first challenge was land. The Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority had acquired this land at Mansi in Khagaria 30 years ago, but it could not take possession. There was no approach road either. We were allotted this land in 2013 on the condition that we would acquire the approach road land on our own, which we did. We had to struggle through all kinds of legal and law and order problems before we could take possession. Convincing a bank for a debt was almost impossible as the banks were shy to invest in a project in a remote place. When we look back, we wonder how we did it all. We thank the Centre and the state government for all the help in this regard. Q4. What’s the volume of investment? Will the food park give employment to locals? The food park is estimated to be developed with a capex of about Rs 130 crore. While the Centre’s grant is Rs 50 crore, our investment is Rs 80 crore. We expect about 30 units to be established over a period of next two years with an aggregate investment of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore. Once fully populated and operational, the food park shall provide employment opportunities to about 2,500-3,000 skilled and semi-skilled people. We expect the local populace shall account for about 80% of the workforce and only specialized technical and management resources may be brought from outside Q5. When will the food park become fully functional? Several components have been completed. The commissioning of cold storage and canning line is pending on account of power supply from NBPDCL and an NOC for the boiler attached with it. We have completed the formalities and expect that the power supply and NOC will be shortly made available to us. While the project infrastructure shall be fully ready in next 3-4 months, the setting up of units will happen gradually and the employment opportunities will also be generated proportionally as the park gets populated. In next three years or so, this mega food park will be the country’s one of the most vibrant food-based industrial parks.',\n",
       " 'GURUGRAM: Two youths, absconding since October 17 in a case of abduction and murder of a man in Narnaul, were found shot dead in a rented accommodation on Kasan road in Manesar on Friday morning. The duo had been hiding here, after they managed to get lodging in a room leased by a Honda employee after being introduced to him as job seekers by a common friend. Preliminary investigation has ruled out involvement of a third person. Police said they suspect the two shot each other in a fit of rage. The duo, identified as Subhash alias Bacchi (22), resident of Naredi village near Nangal Chaudhary, and Vikas alias Model alias Shooter (22), resident of Jamalpur mohalla of Narnaul in Mahendergarh district, had arrived in Manesar from Dharuhera around 20 days ago. Police said they were involved in the recent abduction and murder of Pritam alias Lalu (24), resident of Sareli village in Mahendergah district. An FIR of murder was registered under Section 302 (murder) of IPC and sections 24-54-59 of Arms Act at Manesar police station, based on the statement of the room’s tenant, Mahendergarh resident Vikrant (30). Vikrant told police he had left for his duty at 3pm on Thursday. When he returned at around 7am on Friday, he found his room locked. Peeping inside through a window, he saw the duo lying in a pool of blood and alerted police, who immediately reached the spot and forced open the door, where they found two country-made pistols lying near the bodies. While Vikas had been shot in his stomach, Subhash was shot through the head. Police immediately called in a forensics team. “It appears they shot each other simultaneously, though forensic experts have also suggested that one of them may have killed the other first, before shooting himself,” said ACP (crime) Shamsher Singh Dahiya. “We recovered two 0.312 bore country-made pistols and two empty shells. They might have been drinking before the shootout, as we also found bottles of beer and some snacks in the room. Their families were informed and we handed over the bodies to their kin after post-mortem,” said inspector Manesar SHO Dinesh Kumar. Later, Mahendragarh police informed that Sadar police station in Narnaul had already booked the duo under sections 302 (murder), 323 (causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 365 (kidnap), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and 25-54-59 of Arms Act on October 17, in relation to the abduction and murder of Pritam. That incident had been triggered after Jorasi resident Kapil alias Sonu (24) was nabbed by police for violating the Arms Act sometime early in October. In response, Kapil’s mother Dulari (45) teamed up with Rakesh (34) and the duo — Shubhash and Vikas — to avenge Kapil’s arrest, and abducted Pritam on October 17, on the suspicion that the latter had sinched on her son Kapil. Police said even as they were filling the abduction complaint, they were alerted of Pritam lying critically injured in the hilly area near Nangal Chaudhary. They found him and got him admitted to a local hospital, which referred him to Jaipur, where Pritam died 11 days later. Narnaul police managed to arrest Dulari and Rakesh, but Shubhash and Vikas, whom cops deemed prime accused for thrashing Pritam to death, managed to flee. “Dulari, her son Kapil and Rakesh are in jail, but we were searching for these two for a while. They were involved in petty crimes in the past, and were absconding since Pritam’s murder,” said ASI Ramanand, the investigating officer of Sadar police station in Narnaul.',\n",

But Phase 2, which connected the office precincts of Cyber City to the populated residential sectors, only got a tepid response. Instead, Rapid Metro’s parent company IL&FS ran into financial crisis, compounding problems for the loss-making venture, whose two phases were built for over Rs 3,500 crore collectively (Phase 1 Rs 1,100 crore and Phase 2 Rs 2,423 crore). Highly placed sources in the Manohar Lal Khattar government told TOI talks are on between various stakeholders for the handover of Rapid Metro to DMRC. The talks are being piloted by the principal secretary of the town and country planning department, and a decision is expected soon. The talks began after Rapid Metro demanded a compensation of Rs 1,484 crore from the Haryana government this July for losses incurred by it due to what it called “breach of the concession contract”, which it signed with the state government. Rapid Metro sources had earlier told TOI that in the agreement, it was promised that other modes of transport like shared autos would not be permitted on the metro route once it became operational. It was also agreed, the sources said, that adequate parking space would be provided at all metro stations and other revenue-earning options, like advertisements, would be made available. The Haryana government had rejected these as “baseless claims”. The Haryana government initiated discussions after Rapid Metro informed it would not be able to sustain its operations, a senior government official told TOI on Friday. “The takeover of Rapid Metro by DMRC is under consideration,” said the official, who declined to be named. “Right now, talks are on between Huda and IL&FS with regard to the tripartite agreement and other legal issues involved. Rapid Metro authorities have informed us that they will not be able to sustain its operations and we are hoping to resolve this issue at the earliest possible. There is a clause in the contract which allows us to take over (the Rapid Metro project) and ask someone else to operate it,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity. A DMRC spokesperson said, “We will take it up as per agreement (that is reached).” Sources indicated talks are progressing in the right direction. If it happens, it won’t be the first time DMRC would be taking over privately-run Metro operations. In 2013, it took over the Airport Express Line after Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary DAMEPL pulled out. Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials said the talks are being handled by officials based in Chandigarh. “This issue is being discussed by DTCP officials,” its CEO Vivek Joshi said. Rapid Metro sources said they were waiting to hear from the Haryana government. “We have been following up with the state government for the past few months. Some of us went to Chandigarh last week. We have clearly told them we will not be able to continue this way. When we signed the agreement with the Haryana government, we were told that apart from earning revenue through tickets, we would be allowed to earn revenue through other modes such as advertisement and that that other commercial modes of transport like shared autos will not permitted on the metro route. But this has not been the case and we will not be able to sustain for long, given the condition of the parent organisation,” said a source. There are a couple of reasons why Rapid Metro could not attract as many commuters as it claimed it would before operations commenced in November 2013. The fare hike just 10 months into operations (from Rs 12-Rs 20) did not go down well with commuters as shared autos to the same destination cost just Rs 10. In March 2017, the fare was increased yet again when Phase 2 was launched. A commuter using both Phase I and II stations ended up paying a flat fare of Rs 35. The lack of parking spaces at metro stations did not help. Golf Course Road, meanwhile, was remodelled into an expressway, making the drive down this route faster than taking a metro. Reaching the metro station at Shankar Chowk, a huge catchment area, remains a problem as there is no foot overbridge to cross the national highway from the Udyog Vihar side. Rapid Metro was willing to foot the bill to build an overbridge but was not granted permission.',\n",
       " 'GURUGRAM: Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP, formerly known as Huda) has handed over a stretch of land 9km-long and 90m-wide to National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to build Phase 3 of Dwarka Expressway, promising to hand over another stretch next month. The development has come as a big relief to 1.5 lakh homebuyers who have purchased flats along the road. The stretch that HSVP handed over on Thursday is between the railway overbridge in Basai village and the Delhi-Gurugram border. With this, 10.2km of the total 18km of NPR has been handed over, while another 4km, which is part of Phase 2, will be handed over next month. “NHAI has already allotted the tender to construct the portion of highway that we handed over today. We’re hopeful it will be completed very soon,” said Chandrashekhar Khare, administrator, HSVP. The 18km-long portion of Northern Peripheral Road, being expanded as Dwarka Expressway, is being built in 5 phases. Phases 3 and 4 will be constructed next, with Phase 3 carrying a budget of Rs 1,333 crore, while Phase 4 is tagged at Rs 1,047 crore. The entire project will cost around Rs 7,200 crore. Meanwhile, Phase 1, which is currently being built, is facing obstructions. HSVP is yet to vacate some plots with structures, located close to the culvert that connects NPR with Connecting Peripheral Road (CPR) near Sector 81, and allot alternative plots to their owners as promised. Another stretch of 40m near Kherki Daula is yet to be acquired by HSVP. On top of these, there are trees that have to be felled for the project near Bajghera, for which NHAI has approached HSVP, GMDA and forest department, but nothing has been done yet. HSVP officials though said the relocation of overhead high-tension cables is almost complete. Incidentally, the eviction of plots near the culvert has stalled because the alternative plots allotted are so close to H-T cables, that allottees are unable to build their houses there. Representatives of around 70,000 flatbuyers along Dwarka Expressway who are affected by the delay have, meanwhile, met Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking relief. “We welcome the news that HSVP has handed over land for Phase 3 to NHAI. However, GMDA is yet to remove hurdles for Phase 4 yet,” said Prakhar Sahay, joint secretary, DXP Welfare Association.',\n",
       " 'GURUGRAM: The proposed metro line connecting Huda City Centre with old Gurugram is yet to set out from the drawing board, extending commuters’ wait for a smooth and hassle-free ride from one part of the city to another.  RITES, the agency entrusted with the task of preparing a detailed project report (DPR), is yet to come up with the final layout. Earlier this week, a meeting was held in Chandigarh in this regard. But, according to officials, there is no update or clarity on the status of the report as yet. They claimed the project was likely to start sometime in 2019, though the exact date was not known. “The DPR will be ready soon,” a senior GMDA official said. As per the revised plan , the proposed metro line will start at Huda City Centre, currently the terminal station on the DMRC’s Yellow line, cross the NH-8 at Hero Honda Chowk via Subhash Chowk. From NH-8, it will stretch up to Sector 104 near Dwarka Expressway through Sector 9A and come back. Then, it will go to Sector 4/5 and head towards Palam Vihar and Rezang La Chowk in Sector 23. There are expected to be 20-22 stations on the line. “The route alignment was recently altered to take the metro up to Sector 104, a move that is likely to benefit thousands of homebuyers along the Dwarka Expressway,” said a senior GMDA official.',\n",
       " 'GURUGRAM: A Class 12 student of a leading private school in the city has complained that his two uncles sexually harassed him repeatedly over a period of eight years, between 2007 and 2015. The teen, who turned 18 last month, recently approached the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) seeking help, after police allegedly refused to register his complaint against his father’s elder brothers. The teenager further claimed that he was forced to keep silent all those years as even his father apparently did not believe him. In fact, the 18-year-old claimed, when he had shared his ordeal with his father a few years ago, he had allegedly rebuked and thrashed the boy for “spreading rumours” against his two uncles. While one of his uncles works with an auto company, the other is an officer with a paramilitary force. Finally, a couple of years ago, the boy confided in his mother, who approached police. However, the police, instead of taking any action, allegedly tried to impress upon the boy that nothing had happened. The cops repeatedly questioned the boy, asking him to share the details of sexual harassment he had allegedly faced. Eventually, the police refused to file any complaint in the matter and rejected his complaint as “cooked up things”, the student claimed. When repeated complaints to the police went in vain, his mother wrote to the NCPCR. “The boy’s mother had written to NCPCR, which forwarded the matter to us recently for necessary action,” said Shakuntala Dhull, chairperson of the child welfare committee (CWC) in Gurugram. “After counselling, prima facie, it seems the boy was indeed harassed. The student appeared very disturbed while talking about harassment. Even his past academic records show poor performance during the years he claimed to have undergone the ordeal, while he has been a topper in his class in the last two years,” Dhull said. The CWC chairperson added, “He is still disturbed. During the counselling, when we asked him about his plight, he said it was like mental torture for him as he had been repeating the same story again and again, first to the police and now to us. We have referred the case to the police for immediate action. The culprits should be punished.” Based on the CWC recommendation, an FIR was registered against the two uncles under Section 4 of the POCSO Act at Sushant Lok police station on Thursday. “All that I can say is that we have got a complaint and registered an FIR. We are investigating the matter,” said inspector Arvind Kumar, SHO. While the police are refraining from sharing any more details, sources claim the boy’s mother had moved out of her husband’s house a few years ago. The boy now lives with his mother. She had also earlier lodged a complaint with the police, accusing her husband and his two elder brothers of dowry harassment. They said the police were probing the latest case keeping in mind the ongoing tussle between the two sides.',\n",
       " 'GURUGRAM: The case of the paedophile and alleged serial killer in Gurugram has put the spotlight back on an unsavoury reality — the low rate of convictions of the perpetrators, most often, a fallout of shoddy police work.  In Gurugram alone, 97 cases of sexual abuse against children went for trial between April and September this year, in which there were convictions in just two cases, compared to 14 acquittals. But this is not the full picture. Police didn’t file appeals in any of the acquittals this year. The situation is equally grim across the state, indicating that simply arresting the accused does not fulfil the demands of justice. A strong investigation, followed by an equally strong legal presentation of the case is the need of the hour. Since April, 1,694 cases have gone to trial in Haryana under the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012. Of these, the accused were convicted in only 284 cases (39%), while in 445 cases, they were acquitted. A district-wise breakdown reveals an even sorrier picture — at 13%, Gurugram is among the districts with the lowest conviction rates. Poor rates of convictions in cases of sexual assault, including those of minors, is nothing new in the state. Between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018, around 1,516 POCSO cases were tried, of which, there were convictions in 183 and acquittals in 379 cases, for a conviction rate of 33%. In the same period, 156 POCSO cases were tried in Gurugram, fetching 13 convictions and 25 acquittals. Neighbouring Faridabad and Panipat districts, which have the highest number of POCSO cases under trail this year — at 214 and 188, respectively — also have low conviction rates at 34% and 36% respectively. But as you move further away from the bright lights of Millennium City, an area of darkness opens up. The conviction rates of other districts — Rewari (0), Charkhi Dadri (0), Mewat (3), Ambala (5), Narnaul (5), Panchkula (5), Palwal (6), Kaithal (9), Fatehabad (3), Jhajjar (8) and Sirsa (5) — are abysmal. State-wide, appeals have been filed in only 20% cases this year. It all reveals the low impact of law in the state. Sources revealed that the chief minister’s office (CMO) has asked all districts to devise a mechanism to file appeals in acquittal cases. Dr Rakesh Gupta, additional principal secretary to the CM, has asked police to review all acquittals in Faridabad, Panipat, Sonipat, Jind, Rewari, Palwal, Jhajjar, Mewat and Narnaul, and plan an appropriate strategy while conducting of investigations, to strengthen the case during trials. “In our experience, only 20% of cases are actually reported, in which, collecting forensic evidence within 24 hours — including vaginal swabs before the child takes a bath, changes clothes or even urinates — is of paramount importance. “When these are delayed, the evidence is weakened and the accused get benefit of doubt. There have been instances when cops haven’t even collected bedsheets on which the crime was committed,” said advocate Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, who has represented many child victims in Gurugram. He continued, “At other times, poor victim families get hassled with court proceedings and social pressure, and opt for a compromise which may not even be extortionist, but only because they want to opt out of a long-drawn legal battle. Lack of legal awareness also often leads to recording of statements at the beginning of a case that don’t follow procedure, and fall through later as a result.” Activist Anju Negi Rawat, who counsels underage victims on police probes and court proceedings, told TOI, “It’s important to inform families of victims about what is involved. For example, few know the district administration provides monetary assistance to such victims, as many of them can’t even afford the fare to travel to court. To ensure that justice is delivered, a lot more besides arresting the accused needs to be done.”',\n",
       " '\"Here (the) situation is very tense. May not be able to contact after one or two days... Local security hired by company are armed. They are with locals only.\" It\\'s an anguished cry for help from Neeraj Raghuvanshi, one of the seven employees of IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd held hostage by unpaid workers in Ethiopia. Raghuvanshi, who TOI managed to contact, has been surviving on a diet of rice and potato for the last six days, with little help from his company. His colleagues, C Chandra Sekhar and KP Singh, who have managed to stay free in Addis Ababa, said the situation was very grim and they feared water supply would be snapped in the next few days. The seven employees are under \"house arrest\" and are not being allowed to venture out of their rooms, said one of their colleagues. Raghuvanshi, Sekhar and Singh are part of a group of 15 employees of a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks and Spanish company Elsamex that is engaged in road construction. They are now facing the consequences of the mismanagement of former IL&FS chief Ravi Parthsarathy and his ousted team of executives. The Indian expats themselves have not been paid salaries for months, with some of the dues dating back to April. With funds drying up, the Ethiopian Roads Authority has terminated the contracts and there is a fear that the joint venture may leave behind unpaid dues. IL&FS Transportation Network was unable to pay salary to its 500-600 local staff in October and the dues for November, too, have piled up. The demand is for an immediate payment of around $300,000. \"But the problem will not stop there. Under local laws, the company has to offer severance packages for six months and there are unpaid dues of vendors,\" Chandra Sekhar, the country coordinator for ITNL Elsamex JV told TOI. What has compounded the problem is that even Ethiopian authorities are worried that the company may not clear its dues, creating distress in the African country as the local employees are very poor and depend solely on their salaries for survival. While the problem has been building up, the IL&FS management has refused to provide any help, alleged some of the employees taken hostage. IL&FS refused to comment on the hostage crisis, with a company executive saying that the issue was being handled by the external affairs ministry.',\n",

Met officials said a change in the wind direction helped disperse particulate matter hanging in the lower atmospheric level, making the city’s air cleaner. The 24-hour average of PM2.5 was also recorded at 98.64µg/m³, as against 60µg/m³ that is considered to be the ‘safe’ limit. The last time the city reported AQI below 180 was on September 27. This apart, the air quality remained in the ‘moderate’ level but above 180 on three days in October and November. On Friday, other NCR cities —Faridabad, Delhi, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Noida — reported AQI at 328, 352, 372, 376 and 380, respectively, all in the ‘very poor’ level. “Delhi and other NCR cities remained engulfed in haze as the wind speed and ventilation index were extremely unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Gurugram, on the other hand, witnessed a sunny day. Moreover, a change in the wind direction helped disperse the particulate matter,” said a Met official. The maximum temperature on Friday was 25.2 degrees Celsius while the minimum was 13.6 degrees Celsius. The wind speed was 8kmph. According to weathermen, a clear sky, with mist in the morning and haze thereafter, is expected on Saturday. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to remain between 26 and 11 degrees Celsius.

Anand, which has a bustling fish market, gets much of its fish from the gulf. A recent study by the department of veterinary public health and epidemiology at the College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry in Anand found that fish in the town’s market also contained antibiotic resistant E.coli bacteria.  The researchers, H B Begadiya, J B Nayak, M N Brahmbhatt, J H Chaudhary and K S Solanki, collected 200 fish samples which included the skin, gills, muscles, intestine as well as swabs from butchers’ hands and knives at the Anand city market. The researchers found E.coli in various concentrations in 43 fish samples. The E.coli bacteria in these samples were tested for resistance to 10 antibiotics such as ampicillin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprime and streptomycin. The results showed that most E.coli isolates showed a high degree of sensitivity to chloramphenicol, up to 95.34%, and gentamicin (93.02%). While a high frequency of resistance were observed to ampicillin (67.44%) and streptomycin (32.35%). “Multidrug resistant pathogenic E. coli in the fish market may represent a risk to the consumers,” the researchers claim. Most freshwater fish samples (22.5%) from Anand city were found to be contaminated with E. coli. IIT-Gandhinagar professor Manish Kumar, of the earth sciences discipline, reiterates that stringent government policies to regulate sale and use of antibiotics, better infection control in hospitals, and new standards in sewage treatment are a must. “I urge the public and medical practitioners to exercise restraint towards the use of antibiotics. At the same time, the government should have checks on its sale. We cannot expect treatment plants, for drinking or waste water, to remove every harmful substance.”',\n",

Yet, when it came to discussing it in the general body meeting of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) only 78 out of 155 turned up. The meeting, which was called to discuss the storage water shortage in Pench reservoirs, was put off citing the absence of civic chief Abhijit Bangar. It was to be organized two months ago but was postponed for different reasons. As per the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (MMC) Act, the general body, headed by the mayor and comprising ruling party leader, opposition leader and corporators, is the highest authority in the NMC and not the civic chief. As soon as the meeting started at 11.45am, Opposition leader Tanaji Wanwe sought a postponement due to Bangar’s absence. Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi later said the meeting to discuss the water crisis will now be held on December 7. Both Joshi and Wanwe said the general body is superior in the NMC. “Bangar is on leave due to personal reasons,” said Joshi. “The ruling party does not have any control over the administration. Many decisions taken in the house have not been implemented. The civic chief is the implementation authority and his presence is vital,” said Wanwe. Totladoh, one of two Pench reservoirs, has 128 million meter cube (MMC) (12.58%) as against total capacity of 1,017 MMC. Kamptee Khairi has 56 MMC (39.58%) as against capacity of 140 MMC.

Narwane said, only two tourists with a guide will be allowed on one machan for a fee of Rs1,500. Separate fee will be charged for guide and gypsy to ferry the tourists to the destination. “The project has been launched on a pilot basis and will be extended to other buffer areas like Junona, Navegaon and Kolara depending on the success,” he said. Though machan tourism was launched from November 25, it was only on Friday that the first lot of tourists enjoyed the experience. As of now, bookings have not been made online and will be available manually from Mohurli and Palasgaon range offices. Bookings will be done two days in advance. The tourists boarding the machan at 5.30am will not be allowed to come down till 9.30am. They will have to make a pledge that they are sitting at their own risk. They will also have come along with own material like mats, medicines, snacks etc. Earlier, similar concept was launched in December 2015 in Nagalwadi in the buffer zone of Pench tiger reserve. However, owing to lack of response from tourists, the project was shelved. During the same period, Tadoba and Pench reserves threw open for daylong tourism in the core area from Mohurli and Sillari gates for limited vehicles for a hefty sum but as there was poor response, the project fizzled out. “There is no daylong safari in the core now. Only night safari is being allowed in Nagalwadi,” said field director Ravikiran Govekar. Young naturalist Himanshu Bagde hailed the move by TATR to launch machan tourism. “After discontinuing machan census last year, there was hue and cry to restart the estimation to count animals on waterhole. By launching the machan tourism, people have enjoy the same experience, though it will come at a price. It will also help the forest department to know about the density of animals,” Bagde said. “The Tadoba buffer is equally good as core and there is good wildlife even outside the park. Hence, machan tourism is expected to get good response from tourists,” said wildlife lover Nikhil Tambekar from Chandrapur.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: Along with former irrigation minister Ajit Pawar, even the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) officials are also under the lens of State Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). In its latest affidavit before the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, the ACB has revealed how the VIDC officials in collusion with their political masters and contractors “conspired to cheat the government and defraud the public exchequer”. Quoting Mendhgiri Committee’s report, it claimed the officials accepted poor quality of work done by the contractors with complete disregard to quality. “It’s clear that the VIDC officials while holding office as public servants, obtained several major pecuniary advantages without any public interest,” the ACB said, while clarifying that their acts attracts criminal liability under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and also the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The ACB observed that across the spectrum of VIDC related inquiries, there was a clear pattern with “sinister similarity”, indicative of a criminal conspiracy to defraud the government under the garb of “subverted and sham procedures and through the instrumentality of minions in the department and its corporation like VIDC”. It had already registered several cases for such acts of commission and omission under the relevant acts. The affidavit questioned that whether “recurring features” in works/tenders under Gosikhurd and Jigaon projects are merely coincidental and committed by the VIDC officers alone in collusion with the contractors. “The other question is weather senior officers having decades of experience of working in the government would dare to do the acts in normal course of their working” The ACB added that giving mobilization advance (MA) to L1 (lowest) bidder on the basis of stereotyped note sheet is a “recurrent feature” which was in gross contravention of rules. “The ACB is aware that officials (VIDC) and respondent No 7 (Pawar) take recourse to Section 19(i) of the VIDC Act, 1997, which provides for interest bearing monetary advances to the contractors. However, the grant of MA to VIDC’s tenders unfolds a different picture,” it said. Citing circulars by the irrigation department end GR by the Public Works Department (PWD), the affidavit said, one can clearly read the spirit behind instructions given in these documents. “The government had made it mandatory to declare availability as well as terms and conditions for MA in the tender-document, so that there is greater participation, more competitive bids and fair opportunity to all the bidders. Moreover, a cap of 5% of the tender cost is also prescribed,” said the affidavit. The affidavit pointed out that in VIDC’s Gosikhurd tenders, there was no mention of availability of MA in tender notifications where advance of 10% is given in six works, 15% in one work and 20% in four works. It’s evident that the pre-requisites are not fulfilled while granting MA in VIDC tenders. “Whilst ACB has no doubt whatsoever that the criminal law would take precedence over any administrative rules for conduct of the government business, it had to examine the various opinions furnished by the concerned department during tis inquiry,” the affidavit by director General Sanjay Barve said. The ACB filed five charge sheets before the special ACB court at Sadar Police Station. However, the trial court discharged all five accused, who are retired public servants, for want of sanction from their competent authority under amended Corruption Act. It had already approached the competent authority for the sanction under amended provisions and would file fresh charge sheet subsequently.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Rejecting a petition by 700-odd Army personnel protesting dilution of protection from prosecution under Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in disturbed areas for alleged fake encounters, the Supreme Court on Friday said it ordered a CBI probe only in a few specific cases after finding that the Army had not conducted any inquiry into 15-20-year-old incidents. Dealing with the petition, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and U U Lalit said, \"We are aware of the difficult situation faced by soldiers in disturbed areas. That is why we repeatedly asked the attorney general on action taken on complaints of fake encounters for the past 15-20 years. When we found nothing has been done, we handed over the investigation to CBI in only those cases where a prima facie finding on possible fake encounters had been recorded by high court, judicial commission, Justice Santosh Hegde Commission or NHRC.\" The court said the Army had the option of opting for a court of inquiry even as there were several cases where the Gauhati high court granted compensation and Manipur paid, indicating the possibility of fake encounter. However, the apex court clarified that protection under AFSPA would be available to soldiers for every genuine encounter. Finding the court in no mood to alter its July 8, 2016, and July 14, 2017, judgments ordering registration of FIRs in nearly 100 of the 1,528 cases of alleged extra-judicial killings by Manipur police and Army between 1985-2010, solicitor general Tushar Mehta stepped in to offer the Centre’s support to the soldiers, who in their petition expressed apprehension that it would be difficult to carry out operations in disturbed areas due to fear of prosecution decades later. When the bench said it would not hear the Centre as no notice was issued on the petition, Mehta pleaded and eked out a small window to put forth the Centre’s argument. He said, \"We cannot shut our eyes to the unusual situation faced by soldiers in disturbed areas. Their hands must not shake while fighting terror. At the same time, a balance needs to be struck to ensure that a soldier does not become trigger happy. Let there be a debate on the issue of striking a balance. Till then, the investigations order by the SC need to be stalled. We cannot demoralise our armed forces.\" Justices Lokur and Lalit asked the SG, \"Who has stopped you from coming out with a mechanism to strike a balance? Why does it require our intervention? These are issues you (the Centre) need to decide. We are not stopping you from debating. You can debate and find out a mechanism for striking a balance between armed forces’ operations against extremists and protecting the rights of innocent.\" The petitioner soldiers through advocate Aishwarya Bhati had said, \"The country which doubts its soldiers and their martyrdom is bound to lead to a collapse of its sovereignty and integrity.\" They said they had been constrained to file the petition in view of an extremely hostile situation on ground because of prosecution of officers and soldiers for bona fide actions. It had a demoralising effect on officers and troops deployed for counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations in J&K and north-eastern states, they said. \"Soldiers never hesitate to lay down their lives in the line of duty in order to uphold the dignity of the Indian flag.

But few might know that the tribespersons can know everything about their community member just by looking at their ornaments!  “Maasai’s ornaments indicate their status and their phase in life — infancy, adulthood, circumcision, marriage, elderhood and so on,” said Chandni Karelia, a textile design student of the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad. “For example, children wear white beads signifying purity. When a teen tries to prove his mettle as a warrior, he wears yellow, red, white, and black signifying fertility, bravery, purity, and the tribe respectively.” The woman’s beads signify her village, Chandni said. “Triangles signify huts whereas the cowries hung from the necklace signify the number of livestock,” she said. Intertwined bead strings signify marriage, she added. Chandni, a fourth generation Gujarati settled in Tanzania, pursued design as her career after class XII and enrolled into NID. “Her final year project provided her an opportunity to look back home and connect to her roots,” said Swasti Singh Ghai, discipline lead for textile design at NID. “Having knowledge of the local language, she spent months among the tribes to understand how their way of life reflects in their attire and ornaments.” Chandni conducted workshops for the community to make them self-reliant and respond to international market and encouraged them to come up with new designs with Shuka — the distinct checked red, black and blue cloth, bead and leather work and wood carving so that the community can trade without middlemen and preserve culture.

       " 'Nagpur: Technological advancements have made semiconductors an inseparable part of almost all households. Our dependence on it has grown so much so that India spends more money on import of semiconductors than it does for oil. Despite this, India stands nowhere in the world either in research or manufacturing of semiconductors. This was revealed by Prof Vikram Kumar, emeritus professor in physics at IIT Delhi, on Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of inauguration of a three-day international symposium on semiconductor materials and devices hosted by VLSI Design and Nanotechnology Centre of Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Prof Kumar said, “Labs of five IITs were given funds (about Rs50 crore) for research in semiconductors, but when these institutes wanted more funds for extending the research, the government sanctioned even less than half of what was demanded. This shows that the field is not a priority.” Prof Kumar, recipient of Shantiswaroop Bhatnagar and Vikram Sarabhai awards, said it’s a very complex issue and just blaming the government would not be right. “Semiconductor raw materials for industries like silicon wafers are not available in India. Due to various constraints, mainly finance, it is almost impossible to set up semiconductor manufacturing units here. However, with proper policies, countries like Singapore and Taiwan have excelled in semiconductor manufacturing even though they didn’t have the raw material.” Prof Kumar said semiconductor research is making equipment and parts of equipment smaller. For example, a 14-nanometer base can hold much more chips than ever and yet have a huge memory, which was not the case earlier. Computers are getting smaller and smaller. “Over 30% material in any equipment is electronic and semiconductors. Gallium nitrite (semiconductor commonly used in light-emitting diodes) has already brought drastic changes in energy consumption. It is going to be the next revolutionary material in the world,” he said. Prof Kumar said that organic semiconductors, which are made from carbon-based materials like P3HT, perryline, are also making dent into the industry. But it has its own applications and it cannot replace inorganic semiconductors or vice versa. Use of organic LED in television and mobile improves the display quality. They are also used in RFIDs. But overall organic semiconductors are slower in response. He said that our education did not keep pace with the developments in science and technology. “The education standard otherwise is so poor that it is threat to the country. This affects the employability of students. Autonomy to some extent can help institutes have their own curriculum,” he added.',\n",

Answering a question about MNREGA scheme of UPA, Gandhi said that he supports the scheme. “It’s a good policy and good work has been done. I am looking at Rajasthan where many projects (under the scheme) paid for themselves in one year, be it farm to farm or farm to market. However, what is failure is payment timelines,” he said. Giving examples of current government’s schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and Ujjwala Yojana, Gandhi said that in principle they are very good schemes. It should be supplanted with other factors. “What needs to be done is bottom-up approach and decentralization. Ayushman Bharat is a good scheme but if it is complemented with PHC, CHC, infrastructure of hospitals, it will be better,” said the BJP MP. Gandhi is on a nationwide tour to launch his tome on the rural economy and interventions which he said is result of two and a half years of research. He mentioned that one often comes across discussion on farmer’s loan waiver as an economic burden. “The Non-Performing Assets (NPA) today is not because farmers have not paid their loans - if we take each rupee paid towards loan waiver to farmers and compare it to loan waiver and fiscal subsidies extended to 40 major industrial groups in past 40 years, money given to farmers is 23%,” he said. Gandhi termed India as one of the ‘free’ countries of the world while giving the example of farmer agitation. “Could you have marched in Russia, China or Saudi Arabia? In Trump’s America?

Addressing the two-day farmers\\' protest at Parliament Street, the fourth in the capital this year, the political leaders also backed the demand for passage of legislation guaranteeing ‘freedom from indebtedness\\' and ‘remunerative prices\\' in line with recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission. The meeting saw opposition leaders attack PM Narendra Modi, saying the government failed to meet the expectation of the farming community and the MSP schemes were an attempt to hoodwink people. Led by Left-backed All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), which represents 200-odd farm outfits, thousands of farmers marched from Ramlila Maidan to Parliament Street on Friday. In a report submitted in 2006, the Swaminathan Commission had recommended farm remuneration of at least 50 per cent more than the weighted average cost of production . In August, Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti and CPM MP K K Ragesh had introduced private member\\'s bills in Parliament seeking legislations on farmers\\' right to guaranteed remunerative minimum support prices for all crops and relief from indebtedness. Addressing the protesters, Rahul said, \"Farmers are not asking for a reward or free gift, but only what is their rightful due. The PM promised fair prices, a bonus and an increase in MSP. But he is merely the face of corporate power. Farmers pay insurance premiums that are pocketed by Anil Ambani.

First Year Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) students were stumped to see their paper on Introduction to Financial Accounts was identical to the one their seniors appeared for last year. Questions were repeated and their order was the same too. A student said it was not much of a problem, but those who practised the earlier paper would have found this a cakewalk. TOI has copies of both question papers. Introduction to Financial Accounts is a subject in the first semester of FYBMS. \"It clearly reflects on the quality of question papers MU produces year after year. The examination process at MU has lost its sanctity,\" said the FYBMS student. A teacher pointed out that too many errors were creeping in, especially with subjects in BMS. \"Mostly, 50-60% questions are repeated in question papers from previous years. Students usually prepare for exams by practising question papers in five-six past exams. But to have an identical paper is sheer negligence,\" said the teacher. \"Either the university accidentally uploaded a wrong paper or the paper-setters\\' panel must have not been appointed, and they must have tried using one of three sets prepared last year. Unfortunately, the one picked now could have been the used paper. It is simply unfortunate that no efforts have been taken to improve the quality of question papers,\" said the teacher.

Even after 25 years, I have his pair of cargo pants that I borrowed for ‘Mashaal’ which have almost become my lucky charm.” Shroff, endearingly calling him Baba, said, “He is a dedicated method actor. During ‘Yudh’, one of the movies we did together, I had to even sustain bruises on my face as a result of Baba’s passionate fighting sequels.” The evening progressed with the songs featured on actors like ‘Keh do ke tum ho meri’, ‘Sunn beliya’, ‘Kaate nahin katte ye din ye raat’ and many others to which the audience happily sang along with the artistes. “Cultural festivals of any region or city is a way to connect with people, especially with youth.

       " 'Coimbatore: With CPI (consumer price index) inflation touching a 15-month low of 3.3% in October, the real interest rate or the rate of interest an investor, saver or lender gets after accounting for inflation, has doubled from about 1.5% at the end of 2016 to more than 3% now. During the last time when the economy witnessed such high real interest rates, India’s gross domestic savings (GDS) rose from about 23% of the GDP (gross domestic product) in FY99 (1998-99) to nearly 26% in FY03 (2002-03), which helped current account move from a deficit of around 1% of the GDP to a surplus for three consecutive years. Growth in investments however weakened due to which real GDP growth averaged only 5.5%. Incidentally, the repo rate, the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends short-term money to banks, at 6.5%, is the highest in the past two years. Over the last two years, RBI has over-projected inflation 75% of the time with the actual inflation falling as much as 75 bps (0.75%) short of its projection in the second quarter of 2018-19, analysts tracking the central bank said. “With headline inflation expected to fall below 3%, the real repo rate will rise above 3.5%,” they said. Forecasting inflation has become a difficult task over the past few quarters due to the volatility in food prices. This makes it harder for the forward-looking RBI to do justice to its job. Further, the recent sharp weakness in the rupee may have also prompted RBI to keep interest rates higher, observers said. High interest rates have not yielded the desired results as savings continue to fall and the current account deficit (CAD) has widened. “This, we believe, can be attributed to lower nominal interest rate, since historical evidence suggests that during times of low inflation, household deposits – accounting for nearly 50% of financial savings – tend to move in line with the nominal deposit rates and not the real rates,” analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities (MOSL) said While the real deposit rate for FY18 (2017-18) was among the highest seen during the past two decades, the nominal deposit rate was among the lowest. With higher real rates having failed to boost savings, the GDP, primarily driven by consumption, has grown by a decent 7.1% over the past five years. “If the RBI continues to pursue its current policy of high real interest rates, it will hurt India’s real GDP growth by affecting investments and consumption, which will lead to further disinflation (or deflation),” said Gautam Duggad, head, research, MOSL. “The RBI should consider placing more emphasis on actual inflation than expectations in its policy decisions. If the RBI does this, then bond yields could fall, narrowing its wide spread vis-à-vis policy rates, thus bringing down the real interest rates,” he said.',\n",

Another 25% is from small and medium enterprises — a significant part of which comes from dealer and vendor financing — and 15% from corporate or commercial lending. “We have gone for a granular loan book. Even when it comes to corporate lending, loans of above Rs 100 crore account for less than 7% of the portfolio,” said Sabharwal.

Much of this growth will be in entry-level sub-Rs 6 lakh segments as small diesel engines make way for mild hybridization to meet the new CAFÉ and BS6 regulations. “Right now around 25% of the market comprises diesel cars and this segment will be cannibalized by CNG as some OEMs may stop producing diesel cars altogether,” said Kashyap. “With the vehicle becoming costlier by 60,000 there’s no small diesel viability for BS6,” he added. What makes CNG a more viable proposition in the mass market passenger vehicle segment is the cost differential. “A CNG version is only about Rs 50,000-Rs 55,000 more expensive than gasoline whereas the same model in electric will be double the price,” said Kashyap. “Electrification of the sub-6 lakh category doesn’t make sense at the moment till lithium ion battery costs come down and e-vehicles become more viable,” he said. “So there will be higher level of hybridization in mass small cars where as the more premium segments will see more electric technology,” said Kashyap. Currently India’s CNG passenger vehicle pool is 1.7 million units with the after-market largely unorganised. Shekhar Viswanathan, VC at Toyota Kirloskar said that despite the e-drive the most optimistic view is the “87% of vehicles sold by 2030” will still be non-EVs. “So it would be appropriate at this stage to use all available technologies to reduce fuel consumption which is the end objective,” he added. “If the challenges associated with electric cars such as affordability, infrastructure creation and battery production are not quickly resolved, the number of non-EVs could be even higher.” As for commercial vehicles, auto experts say CNG and LNG will also be strong options in that segment.',\n",

This year, ‘Read N Grow’ saw over 9,100 students writing the questionnaire on ‘Tales of Tails’ at Sandipani, Hazaripahad’. Play ‘The Musicians of Bremen’ was staged which was appreciated by the students. Over the years, books of various authors were selected for the contest with children showing keen interest in reading them. The participation increased with more and more schools joining every year. The ‘Read N Grow’ took a new dimension in 2010 with the introduction of a ‘theme’ for the contest. Fantasy, classics, Indian authors and folk tales were some of them. In the silver jubilee year of the school, the theme chosen was ‘I love my India’. This was a tribute that the students paid to their motherland. The contest is an endeavour by Sandipani to bring back students to written words and the world of books in the age where computers and internet rule the roost.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The Border Security Force (BSF) has flagged concerns over increasing radicalisation of Muslim population in the border district of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan with rising prevalence of \"Arab customs\" even as Hindus and Muslims admit to a shrinkage in dialogue between the communities. A BSF study that examined demographic changes has found a departure from traditional Rajasthani culture in terms of personal grooming such as hairstyles and dress. The study also found a high 22-25 per cent growth rate in Muslim population as compared to 8-10 per cent of other communities. There is a rise in religiosity with higher attendance of children at mosques for more frequent namaz. While warning of radicalisation, the study says there is no evidence of any \"anti-national\" activity and there is no discernible soft corner for Pakistan among the minority population. Also, both communities have not had any problems so far and they conduct business and are cordial to each other, the BSF states. BSF study also talks about an increase in the membership of Hindu right-wing organisations, which are opposed by Muslims. \"The activities of Hindu right-wing organisations have made Hindus in the village of Mohangarh, Nachna and Pokaharan more concerned about their religion. The membership in such organisations is increasing and they are extending their horizons at different spheres of religious activities ranging from training, monetary and communal support to education. However, no direct confrontation with other community has been noticed\", the report says.  The \"study of demographic pattern in the border areas of Rajasthan and its security implications\", notes that areas like Pokhran and Mohangarh of Jaisalmer have seen frequent visits of Muslim clerics, especially from Deoband, Uttar Pradesh. The clerics are reported to \"preach fanaticism and (seek to) unite Muslims as a separate identity with feeling of paramountcy of religion\". There is also an aggressive investment in land, which has now become a bone of contention for the Hindu community, BSF asserts. The growing communal divide is reflected in the \"Hindu community believes that unbalanced rate of Muslim population increase is disturbing the communal harmony of their village.\" The BSF study also names a personage of Jaisalmer (name withheld), who often travels to Pakistan, has business interests there and has emerged as an influential political influence. \"(The) involvement of Muslim population in anti-establishment activities and surfacing of anti-India sentiments on his call can\\'t be ruled out...\" It has recommended a check on activities of clerics, a task force comprising police, administration, intelligence and BSF, to assess any rise in the communal temperature. Asked about the report, BSF chief Rajnikant Mishra said that the force \"regularly prepares these reports based on demographic, social, economic changes in border areas and shares it with sister agencies\".

Police said Yogesh Shenoy initially tried to overdose Lalita on sleeping pills, then tried smothering her, and when she survived, he finally slit her throat. They were at loggerheads for many years over several issues, the most recent being her rising medical bills. Tired of their bickering, Yogesh\\'s wife deserted him in 2011.

He waited for a few hours for her to overdose on the pills, said the police. \"Around 1.30am, he got up to check on his mother. He found that she was breathing.

Seeking to counter China\\'s aggressive expansionism, the trilateral is also the core group that sustains other groups like the Quadrilateral. This is significant because officials from the participating countries have been recently quoted as saying that the Quad was \"one of the many mechanisms\" in the Indo-Pacific.

       " 'NEW DELHI: India is trying to strike a fine balance between the US and Russia, in terms of strategic ties and defence deals as well as combat exercises. Apart from this counter-balancing, India is also stepping-up military ties with the third pole, China, amid the ongoing geopolitical churn. \"India has been a late-starter in defence diplomacy but is now making all-out efforts despite budgetary, bureaucratic and other constraints. Indian Navy warships, for instance, have made 113 foreign port calls and held 16 exercises/coordinated patrols with different navies this year,\" said a senior defence official. In fact, by the time this year ends, India would have held exercises with all the P-5 countries (US, Russia, China, France and UK), apart from other powerhouses like Australia, Japan, South Africa and Brazil as well as Asean countries like Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. \"I don\\'t think any other country has held such a staggering number of exercises with so many nations this year. The exercises promote strategic cooperation, military outreach, confidence-building and interoperability,\" said the official. In December alone, the Indian armed forces have chalked up a hectic schedule for exercises with the US, Russia and China, among others. First off the block will be the \"Cope India\" between the Indian and American air forces at the Kalaikunda and Arjan Singh airbases in West Bengal from December 3 to 14. While IAF is deploying its fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Jaguars and Mirage-2000s as well as other aircraft like Phalcon AWACS, C-130Js and IL-78 refuelers, the USAF has dispatched 12 F-15 jets and three C-130H planes for Cope India. \"The exercise showcases US and India\\'s efforts and commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\" said a US official. Next, the IAF and Russian Air Force will conduct the second leg of their \"AviaIndra\" exercise at Jodhpur from December 10 to 22 after the first was held at Lipetsk in Russia in September. India and China, in turn, will resume their annual \"Hand-in-Hand\" land exercise at Chengdu military region from December 10 to 23 after the freeze due to the Doklam troop stand-off near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction last year. That\\'s not all. Russian warships will head for India\\'s east coast to hold the \"Indra\" wargames towards end-December, even as the Indo-UK \"Konkan\" naval exercise is currently underway off Goa. This flurry of exercises comes after India in September and November held the \"Yudh Abhyas\" combat drills with the US Army at Chaubatia (Uttarakhand), the \"Indra\" mechanised infantry maneuvers with Russia at Babina and the first-ever land military exercise with Japan called \"Dharma Guardian\" at Vairengte (Mizoram). These have been followed by the ongoing \"Vajra Prahar\" combat drills with the US Special Forces at the Mahajan field firing ranges since November 19.

       " 'Mysuru: Launched with high expectations, and with much fanfare, the Mysuru City Corporation’s (MCC) e-toilet initiative was expected to further bolster Mysuru’s ‘Clean City’ image. However, two years after the launch, the ambitious scheme has failed to take off in Mysuru. The toilets, which can be operated by inserting coins, have found few takers in the city, and the problem of public urination – the bane the project was supposed to end – persists in Mysuru. MCC commissioner KH Jagadeesh stressed the need to create awareness among the citizens about e-toilets across the city. MCC officials said that 14 e-toilets had been built across the city. “The concept of e-toilets is good, but the public is yet to understand the concept fully,” said an MCC official. However, residents allege that the e-toilets are not maintained properly, which is why they prefer not to use it. Residents of Devaraja Mohalla claim that the e-toilet near Jaganmohan Palace has not been supplied with water for the past seven months. When the contractor in charge of maintaining the e-toilet was contacted, he attributed the poor upkeep to pending dues on the MCC’s side. “Naturally, payments are due to many contractors managing e-toilets. How can we maintain the e-toilets efficiently if payments are not cleared?” a contractor asked. Endorsing the MCC’s view of the e-toilets being a solution to tackle the problem of open urination, a roadside vendor in KG Koppal Channakeshava Sarvegar said, “But, in most of the places where one sees e-toilets, I see people urinating in the open. Women too are not keen on using them. Most of the time, one finds these lavatories vacant.” Sarvegar called on the authorities concerned to make efforts to raise awareness about the toilets. “No one actually knows how to use them properly. The officials need to take initiatives to make them popular,” he added. MCC commissioner Jagadeesh said that, barring a few, most of the e-toilets were functioning properly. Exhorting the public to use the facility, Jagadeesh said, “Whenever I travel in the city, I use these lavatories. When I find any problem with the facility, I bring it to the notice of the authorities concerned, and ensure it is repaired. There may be some mistakes. But, these toilets are very useful. Women will find it more helpful since the e-toilets are more hygienic. If the residents have found any issue with them, they can alert us, and we will solve the problem.”',\n",

The trio — JSW Cement, Star Cement and Dalmia Cement Bharat — will pump in their funds here in the next few years. This was disclosed by state finance and industries minister Amit Mitra at Cementing India, organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) on Friday. Mitra said that JSW Cement and Dalmia Cement are expanding capacity in the existing locations while Star Cement will set up a greenfield unit in north Bengal. However, the minister urged all the captains of cement industry to set up integrated cement units with clinker facility in Bengal. “All the plants here are grinding plant. We need an integrated plant here. As far as I know, the investment required in such a plant is Rs 2,500 crore,” he added. During his address, Dalmia Cement executive director (new building solution) Sujit Ghosh said it is also contemplating to set up a unit in north Bengal apart from expansion in its plant near Salboni. “There are a lot of activities in north Bengal now. The region is rocking,” he added. Industry sources said JSW Cement is expanding the capacity to 4.8 million tonne per annum from the current level of 2.4 million tonne in the next two years. The total investment for this could be Rs 1,500 crore. Star Cement managing director Sanjay Agarwal added that it would put up a two million tonne cement plant in north Bengal and the investment would be of Rs 400 crore. “The unit will be in Jalpaiguri. We have already bought land for that. The production would start before March 2020. We shall bring clinker from Meghalaya for the plant,” he added. Star Cement has the current capacity of 3.5 million tonne and is a leader in northeast. The company is planning to have 10 million tonne capacity eventually. The cement capacity in the state is now at 22 million tonne but the demand is growing at 18% annually. “There is a demand of 1.6-1.7 million tonne per month in this state,” he added. Elaborating the project, Ghosh of Dalmia Cement added that they is expanding the capacity from 1.7 million tonne to 4 million tonne in the next two years. The total investment for the same could be Rs 1,000 crore. Commenting on their north Bengal plan, he added, “We shall bring clinker from northeast where we have acquired three small cement units in last few years.” He indicated that in North Bengal it may set up an one million tonne unit. Box Sanjay Agarwal, the managing director of Star Cement, has urged the state government to pursue with the Centre and Bangladesh to reduce import duty on cement. Currently, it is 95%. “How Bangladesh can levy such a huge import duty on cement when import duty in India is only 5% and most of the fly ash for cement production in Bangladesh is going from India only,” he added. Agarwal also feel that GST on cement should be brought down to 18% from 28%.',\n",
       " 'Kolkata: B K Birla Group flagship Kesoram may finally demerge its loss-making tyre unit to optimise its potential by the end of December. The company had appointed an investment banker earlier this year for inducting a strategic partner for the tyre business. TOI had first reported on this in July. Kesoram has cement, tyre and rayon businesses under its fold. There was rumour in the market for long that a strategic partner has also been identified. However, Kesoram has denied any such developments. Recenlty, C K Birla Group firm Orient Paper & Industries has successfully demerged its three units — electric, paper and cement — and its combined market cap is estimated to be more than that of the erstwhile single entity. Kesoram had posted a standalone loss of Rs 463 crore in 2017-18 while the consolidated loss was a whopping Rs 577 crore. The tyre business made a loss of Rs 129 crore in 2017-18 while in 2016-17, the loss was at Rs 67 crore. In the last quarter, too, the tyre business reported losses. The market experts have opined that going by the net enterprise value of Kesoram, the market cap at the current level is too low. The capacity of the cement division of the company is 7.5 million tonne and experts feel that valuation of the division would not be lower than Rs 6,000 crore. “This going-by-the-kind of valuation Binani Cement has got,” added sources. Binani Cement has a capacity of 6.25 million tonne and it got a price of close to Rs 8,000 crore. The tyre valuation, according to experts, would be Rs 1,500 crore and other businesses Rs 500 crore. Considering a debt of Rs 3,200 crore, Kesoram supposed to have an enterprise value of well over Rs 4,000 crore. “If you see the Orient Paper and Industries case, then the combined market cap of the three demerged entity Orient Cement, Orient Paper and Orient Electric is more than three times of the pre-demerger market cap. It was only Rs 1,500 crore in 2013 while now it is Rs 5,546 crore. Orient Electric itself has a market cap of Rs 2,962 crore,” a market analyst added. Kesoram which sells tyre under Birla Tyres brand does not have presence in high-margin passenger radial segment. Kesoram had earlier sold the tyre unit at Haridwar to J K Tyres for Rs 2,195 crore in 2015. The tyre division of the company constitutes almost 35% of the company’s turnover. The Kesoram Industries scrip was up 5.68% and closed at Rs 85.60 on the bourses on Friday.',\n",
       " 'Amravati: Is a delicate spider web strong enough to trap a bird, a hundred times bigger that the spider? In the first record of this in India, a bird, probably of Warbler or Prinia family, locally known as Dev Chimni (God Sparrow), was seen caught in a spider web, with a Giant Wood Spider (Nephila pelipes) sucking at it. This rare sighting was recorded by SS Aakewar, a drill teacher at Forest Training Institute (FTI), Chikhaldara, and YS Bhale, director of FTI, during their 19km trek from Kuwapati camp, between Kuwapati and Bichhukheda forest. “We noticed the web near Kargolai camp, about two-and-a-half-km from Semadoh,” an excited Aakewar told TOI on phone on Friday. “We were thrilled, and surprised, to see a bird trapped in the spider web. We had never imagined or read about this earlier,” he said. Dr Atul Bodkhe, an authority on spiders, who inspired the forest department to set up India’s first spider museum at Chikhaldara a month ago, said that nowhere in India has such an instance been recorded. “There have been sporadic instances in other countries,” he said. “The trapped bird was fresh, it might have got trapped there about eight to ten hours ago. The Giant Wood Spider was motionless and sucking at the neck of its prey. The spider web was near a water canal, where there was a deep trench. The web was attached to a tectona (saag) tree at one end and different shrubs from the other,” Aakewar recalled. “We foresters have started taking great delight in recording spiders of Melghat recently, thanks to the workshops by Prof Bodkhe. It took us 25 minutes to take pictures since it was against sunlight. What surprised us most was that while there was abundance of these spiders in the camp, we did not spot a single spider or spider web at Tatiballa camp near Vairat,” he said. Prof Rajshekhar Hippargi of Walchand College of Arts and Science, Solapur, who guided one of the workshops on spiders for forest guards, said the observation is ecologically important. “It is a rarest event,” he said, adding that the knowledge the foresters gained at the workshops is helping them make rare observations. Hippargi said a huge number of Giant Wood Spiders are seen from November to February, and then they disappear. “We need to study if their webs adversely affect number of animals and birds,” he said. “The spiders uses venom and enzymes to kill the prey and digest it,” he said.',\n",

Responding to a move by State Bank of India intimating its intention to discontinue AePS, the UIDAI said in a circular on Friday, “Any action to discontinue such payments or receipt mechanism (AePS, BHIM Aadhaar Pay) or bank accounts on the grounds that it is not possible to distinguish their use for delivery of welfare benefits or other purposes may be held contrary to Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act and the (SC) judgment.” The UIDAI clearly stated that withdrawal of AePS would amount to creating an obstruction in delivery or benefits and may cause denial in deserving cases. The authority quoted the SC order that the purpose of authentication was to ensure that only rightful persons received benefits. “Non-action is not costly. It’s affirmative action which costs the government. And that money comes from the exchequer. So, it becomes the duty of the government to ensure that it goes to deserving persons,” the circular quoted the SC as saying. Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act protects right to human dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution, the SC had noted, the UIDAI said. The court recalled that it had repeatedly expressed concern that benefits for the most needy got frittered away and the particular section of the Act was intended to achieve the stated objectives. “The court is convinced that the Act is aimed at a proper purpose, which is of sufficient importance,” it had said. The legal opinion tendered by attorney general K K Venugopal said “AePS and BHIM Aadhaar shall remain operative and the bank may continue to maintain and provide these facilities so that DBT beneficiaries can conveniently withdraw money from micro-ATMs, AePS, BHIM Aadhaar Pay without having to visit bank branches which are, in many cases, for away from the places where they live”.

A bench of Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice R G Ketkar added the permission is subject to strict monitoring and compliance by authorities to ensure no damage is caused to the temples or the holy wells. Describing the Colaba-Bandra-Seepz underground metro project as of \"high public importance\", the court accepted experts\\' views that tunnelling would not damage the over century-old atash behrams (fire temples) Wadiaji and Anjuman near Princess Street in Kalbadevi. The HC said it \"cannot lightly interfere with expert opinions\", especially when no concrete evidence was brought on record by petitioners to contradict reports placed by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited.',\n",

Speaking to TOI Kurubur Shanthakumar of Sugarcane Growers Association said, “Two months ago price of paddy per quintal was Rs 2,000 but now it has come down to Rs 1,200.

       " 'Mysuru: More than a century old, the City Railway Station is among the oldest train terminals across the country. Now, in the wake of a marked increase in the number of passengers using the station, it is all set for an expansion. The plan includes widening the entrance of the station, and integrating the reserved and unreserved counters under one roof. More than 30,000 passengers disembark at the station, and nearly as many board trains from the city. There has been a perceptible rise in the number of people using the station in the recent past, and taking cognisance of the increased strain on the terminal and existing facilities, South Western Railway (SWR) has decided to upgrade the station. While the number of platforms – the station has six – will remain the same, the parcel office will be shifted to Platform Six, close to the LIC Gate. Following complaints from passengers and motorists about the narrowness of the entrance to the station, SWR has decided to increase the width so as to accommodate more number of vehicles. On the other hand, the plan proposes to add four reservation counters will be set up beside the existing eight unreserved ticket counters. What is more, there are plans to add more counters to facilitate purchase of tickets to unreserved compartments as well. SWR general manager AK Singh confirmed the plan for expanding the station to TOI. Singh, who visited the Mysuru station for the first time after assuming the office of SWR’s general manager, was impressed with the upkeep of the station and gave the authorities at the station a reward of Rs 50,000. He met the SWR Mysuru division manager Aparna Garg and other senior officials. Heritage pillars to stay Amid speculations of the heritage pillars adorning the entrance to the station would be translocated as part of the expansion plan, a senior railway official told TOI that there was no plan to tamper with the heritage structures at the terminal. “The expansion plan will be carried out in a way so as not to disturb the heritage structures at the station,” said the official. - (By R Uday Kumar)',\n",

Kohle, officials of MLWB and state urban development department were present. Kohle told TOI that Fadnavis has set February 2019 as target to restart work. “Only then can the project be completed. It will be very beneficial for the entire city and especially for South Nagpur which lacks any mega sports facility,” he said. Spread over 9.5 acres, the project was planned at the cost of Rs12 crore. Works of Rs7.05 crore were completed between 2003 and 2007. Now the project requires Rs30 crore more for completion. Kohle said NIT and MLWB will enter into an agreement. “The state government will give Rs30 crore of the Rs80 crore it owes the MLWB. The amount will then be transferred to NIT. The NIT will operate and maintain the stadium and the MLWB and its members will get special facilities,” he said.

Now we will concentrate on the two rivers and may be more city lakes,” he told TOI. Earth Echo had 27 global partners so far and Green Vigil is 28th. “We are the first organization from India to get this recognition. It publishes a year book on surface water quality across the world. Now Nagpur will come on international stage,” said Chatterjee. “We have been working with EarthEcho since 2012. They have recognized our work. The fact that all our members hold degrees in environmental science also helped. The founder president Dr Kavita Ratan is a PhD in environmental biotechnology from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee,” he further said adding that the agreement was signed by authorized representative Sean Russell. Elaborating on his NGO’s work till now, Chatterjee said, “We used to take samples from the three lakes before Ganeshotsav, after Ganeshotsav and after Navratri. We used to record the temperature, turbidity, pH value and dissolved oxygen. It was found that the lakes had self-rejuvenation quality. The water quality deteriorated after Navratri but improved by July-August. We basically calculate the effect of human interference.” EarthEcho International is a non-profit organization based in Washington DC (USA), which runs EarthEcho Water Challenge, an annual international programme and equips to protect the dependent water resources.

This, apart from being a rare surgery, was a very risky one as well, and that’s when technology came to the rescue. The hospital’s simulator programme helped doctors to create a 3D model of the child’s head and on it, practice surgeries were performed, thus almost eliminating all patient risks before the actual surgery. The goal of the hospital’s Simulation Program (also called SIMPeds) is to provide medical teams — physicians, nurses, technicians, pharmacists etc — the opportunity to practice and improve their skills in an environment that allows people to learn without risking patient harm. About the case, Dr Dennis Daniel said, “Doctors did scans of the patient’s head and that data was used to make 3D models that were then printed. This model was used to first understand the relative anatomy peculiar to the patient and models were made that could be cut apart and practised on by doctors and the surgery was successful.”',\n",

The revolver was found — along with another country-made firearm, eight live cartridges, 24 live rounds and blanks of various bores, a knife, a screw driver, spanner and other material — in a backpack that Shivalal’s son, Mukesh alias Monty, had thrown out from a moving train between Phursungi and Loni Kalbhor while travelling up to Daund where he was eventually arrested. “The backpack was found along the railway tracks, some 3.5km ahead of the Manjri railway station,” assistant public prosecutor Waman Koli told judicial magistrate first class G K Nandanwar while moving a report on behalf of the investigating officer, Raghunath Jadhav, for an extension of Shivalal and Mukesh’s remand in police custody. The court extended the father-son duo’s police custody remand till December 5. Lawyers Biju Aloor and Tosif C Shaikh, representing Shivalal and Mukesh, respectively, argued that the police remand report did not bring out any new fact or progress in the investigation and the two accused be sent to magisterial custody. Apart from the two country-made firearms recovered from the backpack, the police had recovered a country-made revolver from Shivalal when he was apprehended on the evening of November 21 near Maldhakka Chowk after a dramatic chase that began from the Pune railway station where he had shot at and injured crime branch inspector Gajanan Pawar. The police report stated that the three seized firearms were placed before Shivalal in the presence of two “pancha” witnesses and he was asked which of these weapons he had used for firing at Ekta. Shivalal identified the smaller of the two firearms, recovered from the backpack, as the murder weapon, the report stated. The report added that Shivalal was in constant touch with a Delhi woman, who had hired him for killing Ekta in a bid to terrorize the latter’s husband, Brijesh Bhati, who, the woman claims, owed her Rs63 lakh. He was also in touch with the Delhi woman’s sister, the report said. Investigating officer Jadhav and prosecutor Koli submitted that the father-son duo’s custodial interrogation had led to several new findings and an extension of their custody was imperative for corroborating these findings by taking them to places such as Delhi, Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh and Shivalal’s native place in Rajasthan. The police want to recover a written agreement Shivalal and the Delhi-based woman had entered into for the mode of payment of sum assured for the killing. For this, he has to be taken to Delhi, the report stated, adding that Shivalal had a meeting with the Delhi-based woman and her sister on October 9. He was in touch with the woman on her sister’s cellphone, the report said. The police also want to recover the money paid as advance to the hired killers and ascertain the contract amount. An empty cartridge of a country-made revolver has also been recovered and the police are ascertaining where it was used.',\n",

Excerpts: There is a general perception that there is an anti-BJP wave in Rajasthan and that it will not be elected back to power. I don’t think there is any “sacchai” in them. They are deliberately propagated mala fide perceptions. You can’t sit in drawing rooms and make such baseless perceptions. When you go to the field, you don’t see these perceptions holding true. People respond very naturally to all the things that have happened, are happening. They understand, it has never happened before. There has been a turnaround and it is in our favour. That said, I admit that this is one hump we need to cross and we will be on the smooth path again. Isn’t everything going against the BJP — the survey reports, satta markets? They have changed now.

       " 'VADODARA: Kamatibaug Zoo, the favourite garden for morning walkers, witnessed a major scare when stray dogs left six blackbucks in an enclosure dead on Friday morning. Two other blackbucks were badly injured as stray dogs sunk their teeth deep into the bodies. Blackbucks are highly protected species under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. According to zoo officials, the stray dogs may have entered the enclosure through some openings or scaled its fencing. A security guard at the zoo heard some noises in the enclosure and rushed there. The guard alerted other security personnel at the zoo and the officials were also informed. Three security guards rushed into the enclosure and scared the dogs away. However, the damage was already done. Six blackbucks had collapsed inside the enclosure and they were found dead on examination by the zoo officials. The condition of two others is said to be serious and they are under treatment. Zoo curator Dr Pratyush Patankar said that the blackbucks were sensitive and timid animals. “They would have been scared due to the dogs and may have run amok. The deaths may have taken place due to shock and not because of the wounds by dog bites,” said Patankar. Officials said that the dead blackbucks were disposed of by burning their bodies as per the norms of the Central Zoo Authority of India. An autopsy was performed and a detailed report will be prepared by the officials and sent to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) that manages the zoo as well as other officials concerned. Veterinarians of the animal husbandry department had also remained present during the autopsy of the blackbucks. A source in the zoo said that the blackbucks had bite marks only on their backs. “These could not have been fatal. Only three or four of them were bitten by the dogs,” the source said. The enclosure had 11 blackbucks and only three exist inside it now.',\n",
       " 'CHENNAI: As the government prepares to observe International Day for AIDS on Saturday, the state is witnessing a steep increase in new HIV/AIDS infection among youngsters despite an overall fall in new cases. Public health experts suspect unprotected sex and exchanging of needles in the 10-25 age group in the state to be the major reasons behind the spurt. While increase in cases has also been seen among the elderly, there is a drastic decline among other age groups.  Tho ugh the incidence of the infection in TN, which recorded 43% of all cases in the country in 2003, has come down to less than 10% this year, it has gone up from 160 in 2015-16 to 187 in 2017-18 in the 10-19 age group. At least 99 people in the age group have tested positive between April and October this year. In the 20-25 age group, the number of cases has gone up from 432 in 2015 to 554 in 2017-18. At least 318 cases have been recorded between April and October this year. In the 60 and above age group, the numbers went up to 699 in 2017-18 from 536 cases in 2015-16. This year, 435 cases have been recorded between April and October. ‘Use social media for HIV awareness’ Project director, Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society, K Senthil Raj, said, “There are a lot of dating apps and social media websites that encourage youngsters to get into active sex life. Older methods of attracting target audience such as sex workers and truckers will not work with them. While it is important to keep a tab on conventional spots, it is equally important to use social media and dating apps to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS.” While several surveys, including those carried out by the union health ministry, have recorded significant drop in awareness about HIV/AIDS in the state, funding from the Centre, state and external agencies to AIDS control society too have fallen. This year of the 69 crore outlay, 55 crore went towards salaries. “Most of our staff have been working here for more than 15 years and the salaries have substantially increased. In addition, 13 crore was given to NGOs for various programmes,” said a senior officer at TANSACS. The number of people testing positive at the voluntary testing and counselling centres have dropped to mere 30%. “This means a majority of people are being tested positive at the tertiary care centres where they go with complaints of other diseases or complications of HIV. This also means they are not diagnosed early,” said R Madhuri, a psychologist who has been working in capacity building projects with NGOs. “It means the battle against AIDS is far from over,” she said. “We are doing all that we can to grab the attention of youth,” said Senthil Raj. This year, the society has organised a meme contest to create awareness on the infection. The state had received over 1,000 memes, mostly from people below the age of 30 years.',\n",

       " 'CHENNAI: In a double blow to the state government, the Madras high court on Friday quashed its August 1GO transferring all ‘pending and future’ idol theft cases to the CBI calling it ‘unreasonable, mala fide, irrational and arbitrary’. The court also appointed inspector-general of police AG Pon Manickavel, who retired from service on November 30, as special officer to head the idol wing CID for one year. “The state cannot resort to colourable exercise of power under the guise of policy decision,” said a special bench of Justice R Mahadevan and Justice P D Audikesavalu on Friday. Pointing out that the wing headed by Manickavel had so far registered 26 cases, arrested 102, recovered 8 idols from other countries and prevented 1,106 idols from being exported out of India, which was more than what his predecessors did in the past 28 years, the court said that this revealed the efficiency of the officer. Justifying its decision to appoint Pon Manickavel as special officer, the bench said: “An extraordinary situation has arisen as the CBI has already refused to take up the investigation. This court has to take a decision to protect the idols and temple treasures.” Entire procedure preceding the GO illegal, says court The court said, “In the role of ‘parens patriae’ (legal protector of citizens who are unable to protect themselves) the appointment has been made.” Blaming former HR&CE department commissioner R Jaya for the ill-advised August 1 GO, the bench said: “Strangely and illegally, genesis of the so-called policy decision has flown from the office of the then commissioner of HR&CE department — namely Jaya — who seems to be unjustifiably unhappy because of the action taken by the team appointed by this court and who was pulled up by this court for non-cooperation.” The entire process preceding the GO is illegal, said the court, adding: “The decision seems to have been taken by four officials and not by the state government, within a day, for reasons which would not require an investigation by the CBI or any central agency.” Rejecting the state’s justification that the transfer becomes necessary since the investigation leads to several states and at times to even foreign countries, which requires assistance of the central government, the court pointed out that the wing had so far secured 10 idols from foreign soil. “Pertinent is the fact that the team headed by Pon Manickavel has been instrumental in securing these idols. Even recently, idols were recovered from America and Australia,” it said.',\n",
       " 'PUNE: The six-member Problem Resolving Team formed last week to identify infrastructural and engineering flaws on the roads in the city and suggest measures to rectify them to reduce accidents and fatalities has set about its work.  Its members, drawn from the traffic branch of the Pune police, have surveyed 22 black spots in the areas under their jurisdiction and suggested corrective measures. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Tejaswi Satpute, said, “During the last week, the team visited the 22 black spots in Pune to identify the road engineering problems. They suggested solutions and recommendations which have been shared with civic officials at a meeting on Thursday.” According to Satpute, the team recommended that the condition of roads be improved and infrastructure like broken medians be repaired. “The civic officials have said they will hire a traffic expert to verify all the problems identified by the team and take up work to fix them on priority,” she said. She said the team will continue as a dedicated task force which will go around the city to inspect on-ground problems regularly. They will visit all the arterial roads in the city, speak to the local personnel and officials working for the area and observe the movement of traffic to identify problems. “The problems and recommendations will be sent to me and I will take it up with the PMC,” she added. Head of the PMC’s road department, Aniruddha Pawaskar, said a quick response will be initiated pertaining to the issues identified by the team. “I have a list of the issues identified by the team and have told the engineers from my department to visit these spots with the team. There are several works which other departments will have to take up. Our department will communicate with the concerned officials from the other departments. Accidents at the black spots are likely to reduce drastically if the recommended measures are undertaken. I have ordered a quick response to these issues,” he said. Samaiirah from Safe Road Foundation said the dedicated team must work only on the set task of identifying flaws on the roads and suggesting corrections. “We already know that the traffic police are short-staffed. NGOs with expertise in specific sectors should also survey the roads, suggest technical recommendations and ensure that the corrective measures are undertaken,” she added. The foundation has been working for better signages and road markings. “We can identify flaws and corrections in this area. NGOs working for pedestrians’ safety can work in that field. We can ensure that the makeover of the roads and infrastructure is easier,” she said.',\n",
       " 'AHMEDABAD: Is slower pace of cumin (jeera) sowing worrisome for Gujarat? It seems so, at the moment. If progressive figures of cumin cultivation in the top two producer states — Gujarat and Rajasthan — are anything to go by, Gujarat may have tough time retaining its numero uno position. By November last week, cumin acreage in Gujarat stands 36% lower at 1.22 lakh hectares as against 1.91 lakh hectares in the same period last year. On the contrary, Rajasthan has witnessed 24% increase in sowing area at 3.1 lakh hectares as compared to 2.5 lakh hectares in the corresponding period last year. “Gujarat is set to lose its top position to Rajasthan this year as sowing in Gujarat which is now at its fag end has not picked up because of nonavailability of water,” said Gaurang Patel, chairman, Unjha APMC. Unjha is the largest trading and exporting hub of cumin. Market players also see an advantageous situation for Rajasthan to become as the leading producer as there is a possibility of a decline in cumin production in Gujarat. They, however, opine that a clear picture would emerge only after sowing in both the states is completed in December. Despite recording lower acreage than Rajasthan, Gujarat gets more production thanks to higher yield. Around 3.82 lakh hectares were brought under cumin sowing in Gujarat during the entire Rabi season of 2017-18. The acreage, according to the Spices Board of India, stood at 5 lakh hectares in Rajasthan. “This year sowing activity in Saurashtra, especially Surendranagar, and Kutch is quite sluggish,” added Patel. According to the state government figures, cumin acreage as on November 26 was 39,700 hectares as compared to1.16 lakh hectare during the same period last year. Similarly, for it was it was 10,100 hectares as against 20,000 hectares. Also, area under cumin cultivation in North Gujarat was 67,200 hectares, which stood at 1.18 lakh hectares in the corresponding period of 2017-18. However, the sowing area will increase as sowing in many parts is still underway. Yield of seeds from Gujarat is better Sowing activity in Gujarat may not have reached its full pace, but purchases of cumin seeds for sowing purposes has already increased 10% in the state this Rabi season. This is mainly because farmers and traders from Rajasthan are coming to Unjha to purchase seeds as the yield of the seeds from Gujarat is much better. Traditionally, Gujarat and Rajasthan account for most of the cumin production in India. In fact, divergent views are prevailing about the highest cumin producing state. Federation of Indian Spice Stakeholders (FISS) had placed Rajasthan on top position in 2017-18 with production of 37.83 lakh bags of 55 kg each (around 2.08 lakh tonne) as compared to Gujarat’s 31.40 lakh bags (1.72 lakh tonnes). However, Spices Board of India under Union ministry of commerce and industry pegged Gujarat’s production at 2.91 lakh tonnes and that of Rajasthan at 2.06 lakh tonnes in 2017-18.',\n",

In the return direction, they would be able to get back to Chennai by around 9pm. The travel will be in a swanky new TEJAS express, which will have latest facilities like infotainment, Wi-Fi, CCTV, automatic closing doors and USB charging ports. Southern Railway has planned to operate day-time express train with a TEJAS rake churned out from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) on Friday. The train will run at an average speed of 70kmph, a senior SR official told TOI. It would be run five days a week, the official said. This would reduce the journey time between the two cities from 8 hours taken by Vaigai Express and 9 hours taken by Pandian Express, down to around 7 hours. The fare would be 20% more than that of a Shatabdi Express, but the exact details have not been finalised, sources said. Two rakes have been churned out from ICF which will reach SR’s Villivakkam yard on Friday night. “We are hopeful of starting the service within a week,” the official said. Sources said that after the 497km line between Chennai Egmore and Madurai was doubled and electrified in March this year, the line capacity had reduced to around 70. This opened up opportunities for SR to operate more trains, especially during day-time. In October, during a press conference, the Chief Operations Manager (COM) S Anantharaman had indicated that a day-time super-fast train to Madurai from Egmore was on the anvil. A source said the railway board has not yet given sanction for the train, but it is expected soon. “Till then, it would be run as a special train,” the source said, stating that it would be regularised later. The service would come as a boon to travellers who would finally get a Shatabdi-like service on the route. ICF general manager S Mani, while launching the train, said that since the travelling public in Tamil Nadu are more disciplined, there will be no instances of vandalisation in this train.

This was because he disagreed with how his deposition regarding the time-frame of the sternotomy procedure leading up to the ECMO after her cardiac arrest on December 4 was recorded, sources said. The commission had raised doubts regarding how Jayalalithaa’s brain could have survived the time taken by the medical team to set up ECMO, as the brain would not survive without oxygenated blood for more than three minutes and the set-up would take 25 minutes. A source said the commission’s line of questioning was to ask whether the lung was functional, without which even artificial pumping of blood would not yield oxygenated blood to the brain.

Madan Kumar had also told the commission that at around 3:30am on December 5, 2016, around 11 hours after Jayalalithaa suffered cardiac arrest, she showed intrinsic heart rhythm for 30 minutes, counsel for Apollo Maimoona Badsha quoted the doctor as saying. On Friday, the commission sprung a surprise by summoning Dr R Jayanthi, dean of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). She was asked whether the hospital had performed sternotomy procedure or had the equipment for ECMO, sources said. She deposed saying the hospital did not have the equipment and that they had not performed the sternotomy procedure. Based on her academic knowledge, Jayanthi also gave a deposition regarding the sternotomy procedure being synchronised procedure in stages where the pumping of blood is not stopped, in effect concurring with Dr Madan’s deposition, multiple sources said. The doctor also said they do not perform the CPR procedure in the Critical Care Unit (CCU), a source quoted her as saying.',\n",

He also wanted the body to be constituted immediately, with more than four months having passed since the state assembly passed the bill. Stalin’s reaction came after TOI reported that the proceedings in the proposed lokayukta would be in-camera. In a statement, Stalin said, “The government must give up the decision that the lokayukta should conduct the proceedings in-camera.” He wanted the proceedings to be open to the public. “It has been 128 days since the Tamil Nadu assembly passed a bill to set up lokayukta, but no action had been taken till now,” he said. The government passed the bill in the assembly only after the Supreme Court set a deadline, for states to constitute lokayuktas, he said. “Even during the debate in the assembly on the bill, DMK wanted a lokayukta which is very powerful. But the government refused to send the bill to a select committee. It passed the bill in a hurry,” said Stalin. Stalin criticised chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for not taking any step to set up the lokayukta. “By asking the lokayukta to be silent and hear the proceedings in camera, the chief minister and other ministers want to save themselves, since they are facing corruption charges,” alleged Stalin. As of now, the lokayukta is like a paper tiger and the government wants the body under its feet, he said. “The government must not continue with its present policy on lokayukta and must change it immediately,” said Stalin.',\n",
       " 'PUNE: A 27-year-old woman from Thergaon lodged a complaint with the Wakad police on Thursday alleging that her husband, a homeopath, had administered her HIV-infected blood through saline to secure a divorce from her besides harassing her for dowry. Senior inspector Satish Mane of the Wakad police said, “Medical reports of the woman shows that she has been infected with HIV from January. She alleged that her husband had injected her with infected blood while administrating saline when she was unwell in March last year.” The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. “The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband,” Mane said. He said the police were yet to investigate if the husband was responsible for administering the HIV-infected blood into her body. “Based on her complaint, we have booked her husband and sent her blood samples to a laboratory,” Mane said. Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, “It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a DNA test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link.” The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. “The woman’s father used to give in to their demands. However, the woman later refused to contact her father for more money, resulting in mental and physical harassment by the in-laws and her husband,” Mane said. The woman said her husband hatched a plot to administer her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for a divorce. The husband and his parents have been booked under sections 498A, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. “The husband has already filed for divorce in court,” Mane said.',\n",

       " 'By: Dhairyashil Vandekar The chief minister had announced the approval for the new greenfield airport at Purandar more than two years ago. However, his recent statement about the project likely to be delayed due to the 2019 elections is not entirely unexpected.  Initially, the expansion of the Lohegaon airport and operationalisation of the greenfield Purandar airport were to be done by the same time — around 2020. Questions were then raised about the public money being used for the Lohegaon airport’s expansion when an independent Purandar airport was to become operational almost simultaneously. The prudence of the government decision to do so was being debated as it was known that the MoD wanted all the civil flights, operating to and from the Lohegaon airport, will eventually be shifted to Purandar airport once it becomes operational. This was confirmed when the MoD later issued the NOC for Purandar airport subject to this condition. Delaying the Purandar airport appears to be a political decision as there are two historical “make or break” elections in 2019. With each vote making a difference, going ahead with the land acquisition for Purandar airport would have resulted in opening up of one more political battlefront for the government at this politically crucial juncture. It would have provided an opportunity to the opposition to further politicise the issue and rake sentiments of the people affected by land acquisition. A soft political decision, taken by the Maharashtra CM, to delay the Purandar airport appears to be strategic. Moreover, delaying this project also justified the few hundred crores spent on the expansion of the Lohegaon airport. It is now to be seen if the state government actually declares a compensation package and starts the land acquisition process before the election model code of conduct is announced. With the actual process for land acquisition yet to start, some Punekars fear that the poll outcome will affect the location of the proposed airport. Going by the events and the scale of expansion of Lohegaon airport, it appears that it could almost be a decade before the Purandar airport actually becomes operational. Ideally, the priority of the government should have been to complete the greenfield airport by 2020, as announced earlier, or at least by 2021. Giving precedence to the expansion of the Lohegaon airport and delaying the Purandar airport project will come at a heavy price for the Punekars. The government should have taken into consideration the fact that Lohegaon is a strategic defence airport, therefore, very critical for national security. The civil flight operations from here should be stopped to ensure that they do not interfere with or compromise IAF’s war preparedness. Another reason why the government should have given priority to the completion of Purandar airport is that despite the investment, Lohegaon airport is quite handicapped from a civil aviation point of view. Being a defence airfield, civil flights are not permitted to operate between 0800 hours to 1030 hours on Sunday to Friday due to IAF air exercises and from 1100 hours to 1700 hours on Saturdays when the airfield is closed for maintenance and repairs. With these restrictions, the city is denied flights operations during these prime hours. The single short runway at Lohegaon airport is also depriving Pune of the much needed non-stop intercontinental flights. A few days ago, an airline had to divert its flight to another airport at the last minute due to IAF air exercises. At such times, not only do the passengers with onward connections, appointments and other commitments suffer but the airlines also pay a heavy price. Also, with the steep increase in the number of civil flights, the sole defence runway available at the Lohegaon airport is experiencing wear and tear. To ensure top-notch combative preparedness, its runway and the airfield must be periodically upgraded to the NextGen standards. The expansion of the civil terminal may become ineffective in situations when essential repairs or upgradations come up requiring restrictions on civil flights operations. The government should have foreseen these handicaps and instead focused on early completion of the Purandar airport.',\n",

During the resumed hearing of the case on traffic and parking, Justice Amol Rattan Singh observed that City Beautiful was being run without the application of mind. He said the city was supposedly the planned and smart city of India. The high court also observed that civic sense was expected to be there in citizens while they were on road, but if it wasn\\'t, then they should be challaned for violations as \"without being tough, the system does not work\". Amicus curiae in case Reeta Kohli said after the previous order, the Chandigarh police were towing away vehicles, but that was not the solution, as it was creating problem in residential areas. It was also stated that front lawns in residential areas were eating up roads. The HC observed that roads have been encroached upon for \"greening purposes\" (people have made gardens on them), but it results in lack of space, which leads to parking on roads, cycle tracks and pedestrian ways. The court said the front lawns be demolished. It directed MC, estate office and the SSP (traffic) that all encroachments be broken down and repair expenses be taken from encroachers. The HC directed same action for institutional buildings. Parking policy The HC sought the existing policy on parking and asked why was it difficult to put it on record. To this, the administration replied that there was just draft policy as of now and it was not yet notified. The HC then observed that as there was no comprehensive policy for parking, \"this city is going on without application of mind.\" The HC directed the authorities to put the existing policy on record by the next date of hearing.',\n",

Savita Ray, whose roots are in Chansad village of Vadodara’s Padra taluka, had shifted to Germany 28 years back after marriage. On Thursday, when the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), which is implementing the national high speed rail corridor project, starting disbursement of compensation to the land owners, Savita, became the first lady to give her land for NHSRCL. The 75-year-old lady, who was bequeathed this land from her maternal side, specially flew down to Vadodara, nearly a month-and-a-half back to complete the process of handing over land for the project. Although the compensation amount for the small plot she has received comes to just Rs 30,234, NHSRCL officials are upbeat as the NRI lady will go down in the history for being first woman to hand over her land by consent. After her marriage with Mahesh Ray, who had his roots in Makarpura area of Vadodara, Savita, a class ten pass-out, had moved to Germany. “My husband who had retired from government hospital in Germany, passed away last year,” Savita, a homemaker told TOI. Her son manages a hotel in Germany. “I was informed by my relatives that I need to sign the documents for transfer of my land for the bullet train project,” she told TOI. Chansad, the village known for being birthplace of BAPS spiritual leader late Pramukh Swami Maharaj, had become the first village of Gujarat where the villagers had expressed their readiness to part away their land based on consent awards. NHSRCL had recently also organized a consent camp at Chansad during which formal agreement for land acquisition were signed. There are 45 private plots measuring 16 hectares in Chansad for which NHSRCL will provide a total of Rs 60 crore as compensation. On Thursday, NHSRCL acquired the first parcels of seven plots, measuring 1.57 hectares, for which Rs 8.44 crore compensation has been disbursed.',\n",

       " 'VIJAYAWADA/DELHI: The power struggle between Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and the Central government further escalated with CBI on Friday accusing the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of surreptitiously using information that the central agency had provided to arrest a central government employee. ACB caught Mukku Kali Ramaneswar, superintendent of the Central Tax & Central Excise while he was accepting a ₹30,000 bribe at his office in Machilipatnam. This is the first arrest of a central government employee in Andhra Pradesh after the state government revoked the general consent for CBI action earlier this month and accused the central government of using it to arm-twist political opponents. A miffed CBI immediately released an official statement alleging that its Visakhapatnam office had first received a written complaint from K Lokesh Babu of Machilipatnam on November 28. Babu alleged that Ramaneswar was demanding a bribe for not raising objections in CGST returns filed by his firm. “CBI deeply regrets such non-cooperation by the state home department in this matter,” the central agency said in the statement. “This will only make the fight against corruption more difficult for the anticorruption agencies and the mutual trust between the agencies will be vitiated. Corruption can be eradicated only through mutual cooperation and trust.” AP shared secret info with ACB CBI’s Visakhapatnam SP had then written a ‘top secret’ letter to Andhra Pradesh principal secretary (home), on November 28, requesting the state government to issue specific consent for its officers to lay a trap on basis of the complaint. “It was also requested to keep the information strictly confidential and not to share it with any party,” the statement said. CBI had also made calls to the principal secretary and sent a request to the chief secretary. “However,the government of AP did not issue the specific consent as requested by the CBI, instead the details were shared by the home department with state ACB, which laid a trap on 30-11-2018 in the evening against the above Centre public servant by using the contents of the above request letter,” the statement added. “Further, state ACB also issued a press release as if the complainant has directly approached them.” RP Thakur, ACB DG, said earlier there was a gentleman’s agreement with CBI that the ACB would stick to state government employees while CBI pursued central employees. “Now, with the CBI role in the state being curtailed, ACB has taken this as a first case,” Thakur told TOI. Soon after Ramaneswar took money at 5.20 pm, sleuths barged into the office and recovered the amount. He tested positive in phenolphthalein test.

The report was tabled in the assembly on Friday. TOI, on October 29, 2016 had reported how government violated norms by enlisting a few contractors, including ULCCS, as accredited agencies and awarded work on nomination basis. The government in August 2015 had issued guidelines for selection of accredited agencies to execute public works. Audit noticed that PWD did not exercise due diligence in selection of accredited agency through tendering and entrusted five works amounting to Rs 809.93 crore to ULCCS at estimate rates. It said that it was violation of CVC guidelines and Kerala Financial Code. “As per the guidelines for selection of accredited agencies, the maximum value of a single work that could be entrusted with ULCCS was Rs 25 crore and the maximum quantity of work that could be held by the society at a time was Rs 250 crore. It was noticed that even the smallest of the works entrusted was worth Rs 51.42 crore and the maximum work in hand was Rs 809.93 crore, thus violating the guidelines issued by the government,” it said. The audit also found that PWD had incurred loss due to faulty designs and delay in land acquisition. For example, in the audit conducted in select circles of roads and bridges wing of PWD, eight works worth Rs 59.98 crore, awarded to contractors, could not be completed due to faulty design and land disputes/delay in acquisition of land despite spending Rs 33.34 crore on the works. This included Rs 2.85 crore on a bridge across Thodupuzha River, which remained unused due to lack of approach road, wasting the entire amount, the report said. The audit report noted that PWD had totally ignored the defect liability period – which makes contractors responsible for maintenance works along a stretch developed by them – for quite a while. Though the defect liability period (DLP) of roads renewed with bituminous macadam and bituminous concrete was 24 months, the report observed that a renewal work – worth Rs 1.84 crore – was taken up during DLP, which was equal to extending unintended benefit to the contractor, CAG noted. Audit criticized PWD for delay in finalization of tenders. “Audit noticed that in eight instances, non-finalization of tender process within the firm period led to arrangement of works through second-lowest bidder or retendering, resulting in excess cost of Rs 21.19 crore,” it noted.',\n",

It said that it was violation of CVC guidelines and Kerala Financial Code. “As per the guidelines for selection of accredited agencies, the maximum value of a single work that could be entrusted with ULCCS was Rs 25 crore and the maximum quantity of work that could be held by the society at a time was Rs 250 crore. It was noticed that even the smallest of the works entrusted was worth Rs 51.42 crore and the maximum work in hand was Rs 809.93 crore, thus violating the guidelines issued by the government,” it said. The audit also found that PWD had incurred loss due to faulty designs and delay in land acquisition. For example, in the audit conducted in select circles of roads and bridges wing of PWD, eight works worth Rs 59.98 crore, awarded to contractors, could not be completed due to faulty design and land disputes/delay in acquisition of land despite spending Rs 33.34 crore on the works. This included Rs 2.85 crore on a bridge across Thodupuzha River, which remained unused due to lack of approach road, wasting the entire amount, the report said. The audit report noted that PWD had totally ignored the defect liability period – which makes contractors responsible for maintenance works along a stretch developed by them – for quite a while. Though the defect liability period (DLP) of roads renewed with bituminous macadam and bituminous concrete was 24 months, the report observed that a renewal work – worth Rs 1.84 crore – was taken up during DLP, which was equal to extending unintended benefit to the contractor, CAG noted. Audit criticized PWD for delay in finalization of tenders. “Audit noticed that in eight instances, non-finalization of tender process within the firm period led to arrangement of works through second-lowest bidder or retendering, resulting in excess cost of Rs 21.19 crore,” it noted.',\n",
       " 'CHENNAI: Terming it a violation of an order of the Supreme Court, the Tamil Nadu government on Friday moved the apex court seeking a stay on permission given by the Centre to the Karnataka government for preparing a detailed project report for Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project across the inter-state Cauvery river. The Centre’s decision taken “without properly considering the genuine and justifiable objections of Tamil Nadu is wholly unjust,” the state said in its petition. TN law minister C Ve Shanmugam, who said that only the Cauvery Water Management Authority had the powers to decide on the issue and not the Central Water Commission, ruled out talks with Karnataka. “The Centre’s permission amounts to contempt of court,” he said. ‘K’taka didn’t bother to respond to letters on farmers’ plight’ The minister said, “They get wrong orders and want to hold talks. We are neither ready to believe them nor be fooled by them. Karnataka didn’t even have the respect to respond to the letter written by our CM for talks on farmers’ plight (early this year owing to drought).” In its petition, Tamil Nadu stated the decision of the CWC was in utter disregard to the adjudication rendered by the Supreme Court. “The attempt of Karnataka is to increase its storage capacity and enhance its irrigation which would be in gross violation of the decision of the tribunal as modified by the court, besides seriously jeopardizing the rights of the inhabitants of Tamil Nadu to the flows of the inter-state river Cauvery,” the petition said, seeking directions to CWC to withdraw the letter dated November 22 issued to Karnataka granting permission for the DPR. Karnataka’s plan is to construct a reservoir at Mekedatuwith a capacity of 67.16tmcft and generation of 400MW power at ₹5,912 crore. It was only in June -- after four decades of legal battle by Tamil Nadu, Centre set up Cauvery Water Management Authority and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee for implementation of Cauvery tribunal award as modified by the Supreme Court in February. However, the screening committee of CWC gave clearance to Karnataka on October 24 to prepare DPR, subject to certain conditions. “Direct Karnataka and its instrumentalities, namely Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited, to maintain status quo till the disposal of the present application,” the petition said, contending that the CWC had granted permission ignoring the objections of Tamil Nadu. If any new storage structure is permitted to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu will not be able to get its due share of water as per monthly schedule even in normal years. In deficit years, Karnataka will wholly appropriate the waters, depriving TN of its due share, it said.',\n",

The Metro agency expressed hope that the project would be commissioned along the stretch by December 2021. A public protest, including human wall, is planned at Tripunithura on Saturday. Regarding the execution of preparatory works, particularly road widening, to be executed from Pettah to SN Junction, the Metro agency said that the state government had already sanctioned works worth Rs 123 crore. “Land acquisition process is in its final stage and total land for the preparatory work is expected to be in place by the end of January 2019. Tender for road widening has already been invited and the work is expected to be awarded by next month,” said a KMRL official. Major civil works for the Metro include construction of viaduct, stations and Panamkutty bridge (popularly known as Pettah bridge). The contract consists of two-kmlong viaduct, construction of additional two lanes for Panamkutty bridge and two stations namely, Vadakkekotta & SN Junction. The state government had sanctioned the project cost of Rs 359 crore, and the Metro agency has submitted a revised project cost before the government taking into consideration price escalation. The detailed design consultancy for the work was awarded to L&T Infrastructure Engineering Ltd on June 2018 and tender preparation for the major civil work is in the final stage. “Tender for viaduct and stations will be invited by next month and contractor for the work will be in place by January 2019, which will ensure to commence the work on ground by February 2019,” added the KMRL official. The second stage extension of phase-one of the project from SN Junction to Tripunithura Terminal consists of 1.2-km-long viaduct and Tripunithura Terminal Metro station. The Tripunithura municipality has requested the Metro agency to consider taking the Metro alignment to Tripunithura through the proposed new road and bus depot near Tripunithura railway station. “KMRL revised the detailed project report submitted to the government on August 14, 2018, for an amount of Rs 356 crore. Administrative sanction for the stretch is expected soon. The local body gets nod of the government for taking over land for Metro station, railway station and bus depot,” said the KMRL official. KMRL MD A P M Mohammed Hanish had earlier said that work till Thykoodam would be completed by March 2019, and by another six to seven months the stretch till Pettah would be ready.',\n",
       " 'BENGALURU: With Bengaluru’s traffic crawling, pavement users are at risk. The number of motorists caught riding on the pavements (to beat traffic snarls) has increased from 16,069 in 2016 to 18,889 in 2017 and 23,059 till October 2018. The city has nearly 78 lakh vehicles, including 54.1 lakh two-wheelers. The average vehicle speed in the city during peak hour is 10kmph. Two-wheeler riders think they can vroom past bigger vehicles by climbing the footpaths. Traffic police officials said two-wheelers riding on footpaths are charged with dangerous driving and the riders must pay Rs 300 as fine. A senior traffic police official said: “The rise in the number of cases is also an indication of better law enforcement. It’s difficult to book cases during peak hours since our officials are busy managing traffic.” Between 2015 and 2017, as many as 942 pedestrians were killed in road accidents across the city. Between January and October this year, 226 pedestrians were killed and 1,003 injured in accidents. Motorists riding on footpaths are charged with dangerous driving Pavement riding is highest during peak hours: Walkers Many pedestrians said the menace of pavement riders is rampant across the city, particularly during peak hours. Manju Thomas, whose video of preventing bike riders from using pavements went viral, said civic authorities should provide barriers or bollards on pavements to prevent footpath riding. “While police should intensify crackdown against footpath riders, public should use apps to upload pictures of the violators,” Thomas said. “Some bikers honk if we don’t move from the footpaths. As it is, pavements are broken, and there is hardly any place for walkers,” said Sneha S from Indiranagar. Violation of lane discipline Desperate to reach their destination, motorists are increasingly riding on footpath, violating lane discipline and no-entry rules. Bengaluru traffic police listed the number of motorists booked for not following lane discipline: 4 lakh in 2016, 4.6 lakh in 2017 and 3.4 lakh in 2018 (till October). Similarly, violation of no-entry rules increased from 4.4 lakh in 2016, 4.9 lakh in 2017 to 3.9 lakh till October 2018.',\n",

Compartmental exams will be held in the third week of July every year and results will be published in August. Class-XII examinees, who pass in English and two other subjects, can write the compartmental exam if they fail in the fourth subject; Class-X examinees, who pass English and three other subjects, can write these compartmental exam if they fail in the fifth subject. “This is the first time we are introducing compartmental exams as we want to give unsuccessful students one more shot at passing the board exams without waiting for a year,” Council CEO Arathoon said. Separate marks for physics, chemistry and biology The other major reform will ensure Class-X board examinees get to know their score in every subject. “Students appear in three separate papers — physics, chemistry and biology — and can score a maximum of 100 marks in each. But the marksheet, till this year, showed only students’ ‘Science’ marks, which were an average of the scores they got in the three subjects. Similarly, students would get to know their ‘English’ marks, which were an average of their scores in the two English papers (language and literature).

They can opt for a different curriculum in these subjects,” Arathoon said. Another change will kick in from the 2021 exam; both ICSE and ISC English Literature students will have to choose from only three texts (instead of a plethora of options available now). The council’s main thrust from now would be digital, officials said. “A customised time-table for the exams will be put out online for principals; it will be uploaded on December 3,” Arathoon added.',\n",

BJP declared a total income of Rs 1,027 crore for 2017-18, CPM Rs 104.8 crore, BSP Rs 51.7 crore, Trinamool Congress Rs 5.17 crore and CPI Rs 1.55 crore. Congress and NCP are yet to submit their annual audit reports to the Election Commission. In 2016-17, BJP had declared an income of Rs 1,034 crore, CPM Rs 100 crore, BSP Rs 173 crore, Trinamool Congress Rs 6.09 crore and CPI Rs 2 crore. As per BJP’s audit report for 2017-18 submitted to the EC, the party encashed electoral bonds worth Rs 210 crore out of the total Rs 222 crore issued by banks in the year, covering only the first tranche relating to the period March 1-10, 2018.  However, there was a fall in ‘other contributions’ to BJP from Rs 923 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 714 crore in 2017-18 and also in total value of donations above Rs 20,000 received, from Rs 529 crore to Rs 438 crore. This is seen as an indication that corporate houses and major donors to the party may have chosen the electoral bonds route over making direct contributions that, if in excess of Rs 20,000, would require their details to be furnished by parties in contributions reports to the EC. Association for Democratic Reforms founder Trilochan Sastry said compared to Rs 438 crore received by BJP in Rs 20,000-plus donations, voluntary contributions worth Rs 552 crore (58 per cent of total contributions) to the party were from anonymous sources. None of the other four national parties that have filed their annual audit accounts for 2017-18 — BSP, CPM, CPI and Trinamool Congress — declared any income through electoral bonds.

The maqbara has become the first building for which heritage bylaws, drafted under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 2010, were made public on Friday. National Monument Authority (NMA) member secretary Navneet Soni told TOI, “There are more than 3,600 centrally protected monuments in the country and ASI is preparing bylaws for each of them. Amjad Ali Shah’s maqbara is the first for which bylaws could be prepared. The next is Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi, along with two other structures,” he said.  Soni added that monument specific bylaws were needed to deal with specific problems being faced by each monument. The heritage bylaws have been uploaded on NMA and ASI websites and people have been urged to send in their comments and suggestions till December 28. NMA has to send the draft bylaws to Parliament for clearance by January 2. The bylaws specify details of the construction activities permitted within the restricted and regulated areas which are in 100 m and 300 m radius, respectively, around protected monuments and laying rules for height of structures, their façade and construction material to be used. Only repair and renovation is permitted in restricted area while construction is allowed in regulated zone after approval. ASI’s Lucknow circle has 328 centrally protected monuments while UP has more than 700, which is a fifth of the total centrally protected monuments in the country. City maqbara picked up 1st for being single monument The AMASR Act was drafted in 2010 with directions that bylaws be prepared within the next five years but work started only in 2016. “ASI was not making site plans by carrying out total station surveys. This was delaying work. Finally, the surveys were carried out using ISRO satellite imagery,” Soni said. Drafts for around 50 monuments have been sent to NMA for clearance but the Lucknow maqbara was picked up first since it is a single monument. NMA has given a priority list of 600 monuments to ASI for preparing bylaws. “Our plan is to integrate the NMA website with those of local bodies so that applications for construction and renovation around a centrally protected monument are decided online. I wrote to UP chief secretary last year to ensure that local bodies are computerised and integrated with NMA website but we have not heard from them yet,” he said. Amjad Ali Shah, the fourth nawab of Awadh, started construction of the imambara in 1847. After his death, it was completed by his son Wajid Ali Shah. In 1870, it was converted to a church by Collin Campbell to establish British Supremacy over the area. The monument also contains the tombs of Amjad Ali Shah, his grandson Mirza Javed Ali and Najm-un-Nissan Begum, queen of Wajid Ali Shah. Mohammed Haider, the mutawwali of Sibtainabad Imambara, welcomed the development. “We had been pushing for these bylaws and are happy that they have finally been prepared. We hope that this will pave the way for bylaws for other monuments also,” he said.',\n",

       " \"KOLKATA: An environment law that was introduced in Bengal during the British Raj and allowed smoke inspectors unfettered access to homes and factories to check whether chimneys were spewing out noxious fumes, is set to be repealed 113 years after it was enacted.  Though the law has for all purposes been defunct for decades, Victorian literature has kept alive the saga of chimneys and their heartless cleaners, chimney sweeps, men who sent up children as young as four up hot chimneys to clean up the soot. In Charles Dickens’s ‘Oliver Twist’, young Oliver is saved by a magistrate from the clutches of a vicious chimney sweep called Gamfield. English poet William Blake portrayed chimney sweeps in both ‘Songs of Innocence’ and ‘Songs of Experience’. Chimney sweeps also inspired Michael Crichton’s novel ‘The Great Train Robbery’ and Charles Lamb’s essay ‘The Praise of Chimney-Sweepers’. The practice came to an end in the UK through a legislation in 1875. The Bengal Smoke-Nuisance Act came into being much later in 1905, the year the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, announced the Partition of Bengal. It aimed to curb “nuisance arising from the smoke of furnaces or fire-places in the towns and suburbs of Calcutta and Howrah”. Along with a detailed definition on smoke, the law made it mandatory for permission to be sought before setting up chimneys and furnaces. Any breach could lead to a month in prison along with a fine of Rs 2,000. A second offence could result in a fine of Rs 5,000 and two months in jail. Following the Act, the West Bengal Smoke Nuisances Commission was set up and a chief inspector-smoke nuisances and several deputies were appointed to enforce it across the state. The law allowed the commission to fix the permissible smoke density for coke used in chimneys and furnaces. If the smoke was of greater density than permitted, and found to be hanging at a lower altitude, the smoke inspectors were empowered to take penal measures and even demolish the chimneys. ‘Old smoke law is irrelevant now’ What was draconian about the law was that the smoke inspectors could enter anywhere at any time of the day without prior notice, if they felt the law was being flouted. The only exception was if the home owner was a woman who customarily didn’t appear in public. In such cases, the inspector was required to serve a notice so that she withdrew from the scene to allow the inspection. “The 1905 law is largely irrelevant now. Use of coke in homes has been discontinued since 80s. Large-scale production and usage of coke, or coal, now falls within the ambit of other laws and central environmental regulations. A bill to repeal it will be introduced in the assembly soon,” said a senior environment department official. The state law department and the Centre have already given the nod for its abolition. Some environmentalists though wonder if the Act should really be repealed and suggest it be amended to create smoke inspectors who go around checking the burning of garbage, litter and dry vegetation in public places across the city in winter, adding to the city's ambient air pollution.\",\n",

       " 'LUCKNOW: Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, a six-time independent MLA who has been a minister in three governments, announced the launch of his political party, Jansatta Dal, on Friday on completing 25 years in politics and said that he would fight for ‘equality’ among all castes in society. Raja Bhaiya said that he would fight for justice to general category candidates who are being discriminated against in education and government jobs due to the reservation policy. “I know fighting for justice to all sections of society and challenging appeasement of certain castes is a risky path. But I have made this beginning and others will soon realise this injustice and follow me,” said Raja Bhaiya, addressing a mammoth rally at the sprawling Ramabai Ambedkar ground while floating his outfit ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In a show of massive support for the MLA from Kunda assembly constituency in Pratapgarh, the vast ground was completely packed with his supporters and followers even before his arrival. “Kunda is going to script a new destiny of the society which will see end of injustice,” announced Raja Bhaiya, drawing heavy applause from the crowd. Referring to the resentment among upper castes against reservation and special benefits given to SCs, STs, Raja Bhaiya said that all people should be given same facilities and there should be no discrimination. He also opposed the ‘draconian’ provisions of the SC/ST Act and questioned compensation in rape and murder cases only to Dalits. Raja Bhaiya challenges sops to SCs “If a Dalit girl is raped she gets a financial assistance of Rs 1lakh or more, but if a girl of upper caste faces same trauma, there is no assistance from government. I am not saying Dalits should not get assistance, but what I am demanding is that all victims of heinous crimes should get assistance from government, irrespective of their being Brahmins, Rajputs or other castes. This kind of discrimination has to end at any cost,” said Raghuraj drawing thunderous applause from thousands of youth, mostly of upper castes, who responded by raising slogan “Raja tum sangharsh karo, hum tumhare saath hain.” One by one, Raghuraj counted the benefits given to SCs and STs by government and challenged them. “I appeal the government not to give reservation benefits to creamy layer and those who have availed it once. Where is justice in giving reservation benefits to siblings of IAS and IPS officers who should rather set example by voluntarily surrendering reservation benefits in the same manner as wealthy people left LPG subsidy,” he said. “If the creamy layer surrenders reservation benefits, people of their own caste who remain deprived and downtrodden otherwise could benefit. In present system, only few people at the top get all the benefits and others remain deprived,” he said. “When all are equal in the eyes of the Indian Constitution, how can some people be given benefits and others be deprived of them due to their caste,” said Singh. “My party will fight for ending this discrimination and injustice. It does not matter even if I am taking a risk. Today, I am lighting a spark which will light up the society in the days to come,” said Raja Bhaiya.',\n",
       " 'KOLKATA: The South City mall management on Friday evening conducted a special briefing of senior staff, including floor managers, housekeeping department and security personnel, to sensitize them on the need to respond to customers with empathy. They have been told to contact the mall head, or the vice-president, if they are not sure how to help a patron.  The dissemination of instructions to the mall staff comes in the wake of Sunday’s incident in which a mother desperate to breastfeed her baby was denied assistance by the mall staff and even refused entry into a changing room that was undergoing renovation. The briefing carried out by mall head Deep Biswas addressed heads of all departments — floor managers, customer care, security, housekeeping, parking, engineering and fire. The message delivered was unambiguous: Go the distance to help a person in need. “Do not turn away or rebuff anyone who comes for help. Be on the lookout for someone who appears to be in need of assistance. Politely approach the person and ask: ‘May I help you?’ If you are unable to help with the problem, do not hesitate to contact me directly. When it comes to queries related to customers, the chain of command does not apply,” Biswas told the dozen-odd staffers assembled at the mall atrium. Usually, the briefing is carried out by the heads of different departments. But now the mall top brass has decided that a senior official will speak to the heads on a regular basis and they will, in turn, brief the staffers on all three shifts. Attending the soft briefing by departmental heads prior to their shifts every day has been made mandatory for all employees. “We have formed a panel of senior staffers to whom we will provide training and inputs on customer-related matters on a regular basis,” explained mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. On Sunday, several people that Abhilasha (Paul) Das Adhikari had approached, including security persons, housekeeping staffers and storekeepers, refused help. She needed a private space to breastfeed her baby, something that could have been easily provided in the mall that is eastern India’s largest. “The customer could have been helped in a number of ways. She could have been escorted to the first-floor changing room that was being renovated but was still usable. She could have also been guided to the mall office where we would have made the necessary arrangements,” said Bagree. In case a staffer is unable to understand a customer’s requirement, it has been instructed that the former should contact the floor manager. If the floor manager is not in sight, the employee can contact Biswas. Earlier, only department heads were allowed to call him. The mall management is also on the lookout for soft-skill training professionals to train the front-line staff. “We want people skills to be upgraded several notches. This is applicable to everyone who comes in contact with customers, like security persons, floor managers, housekeeping staff and parking attendants,” Bagree added.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: Despite significant progress in containing the spread of HIV among the general population, over 600 pregnant women have tested positive for the virus in the state this year. In the last five years, over 6,300 women were detected with the virus during pregnancy, underlining the urgent need to reach out to people who may be living with the virus but are unaware of their status.  This World AIDS Day, as there is a global clamour for expansion of HIV-testing and treatment under the theme of ‘Know your status’, activists demanded that government agencies must push facilities deeper into the community. Dr Ashok Anand, who heads the gynaecology department at JJ Hospital, that carries out a massive volume of HIV positive childbirths, said even today, hundreds of women find out their status only during their pregnancy. “Most women get the infection from husbands. In fact, many husbands know about their HIV status only when their wives are pregnant,” said Dr Anand. Data from Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 92% of infections are due to unsafe sex, a significant percentage of which is among heterosexual couples. The remaining are caused by transfusion with infected blood, use of infected needles or from mother to child. Dr Anand said prevention was better as always, as an infected mother also stands the risk of passing on the virus to the child. While with multiple-drug regimen the incidence of mother-to-child transmission has reduced a great deal, some babies continue to get the infection from mothers. Since 2014-15, nearly 300 babies have got HIV infection from mothers in the state. Activist Ganesh Acharya said it was time to remodel targeted interventions and penetrate communities deeper. “We need more behaviour change communication to encourage more to get tested,” he said, adding that people still getting HIV in large numbers suggest that programmes may be failing. Maharashtra State Aids Control Organisation (MDACS) officials said a decade ago more than 4,000 pregnant women tested positive every year. “The number of women testing positive declined by 85% over 10 years, even as women being screened more than doubled,” said a senior official. He said from nearly 8 lakh in 2008, over 21 lakh pregnant women were now being screened annually in Maharashtra. MDACS assistant project director Dr Shrikala Acharya said to facilitate testing BMC has tied up with 113 outlets of Metropolis where HIV test will be carried out for Rs75 for a week from December 1.',\n",

Reacting to the allegation that the TDB had given contract for annadanam to a Sangh Parivar-leaning group, Padmakumar said that the TDB had not given charge to conduct annadanam to anybody. \"We are only receiving the materials needed for preparing food and the voluntary workers needed for that. Cooking food and the whole process is under the supervision of the TDB,\" he said. The TDB is bound to give annadanam round-the-clock till \\'Makaravilakku\\' at Sannidhanam, Pamba, Nilackal and Chengannur. Padmakumar said the total expense for this was Rs 6.25 crore and the TDB has only Rs 2 crore to spend. \"In such a scenario, TDB has to receive support in the form of food materials and will welcome the voluntary workers but they will not be given any responsibility. The annadanam will be done under TDB\\'s supervision,\" he said. Any organization which fulfils the directives of the high court and the existing rules regarding annadanam should be welcomed, he added. Earlier, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had alleged that the board had given contract for annadanam to a Sangh Parivar outfit.

       " 'KOLKATA: Hundreds of students of Heramba Chandra College, popularly known as South City College, in south Kolkata went on the rampage at Golpark on Friday, blocking the crossing for more than an hour, vandalizing vehicles and hurling around police guardrails. Their demand was that they be allowed to sit for their first-semester examinations though they did not have the mandatory 60% attendance.  Trouble started with the college authorities publishing a list of BCom Honours students who did not have 60% attendance, a condition must for appearing for exams. The first list mentioned the names of 430 out of the 700 BCom first-year students who failed to attain the attendance cut-off. However later, the college authorities brought down the minimum attendance to 55% and struck off the names of 65 students. Remaining 365 students were barred from entering the campus, where forms for the first-semester exams were being filled. But the students demanded that everyone be allowed to sit for the exams—irrespective of their attendance percentage—and took their violent demonstration on to the road, creating mayhem in the locality. The police apparently stood as silent observers. “The students started their protest outside the college gate. On realizing the authorities would not give in to their demands, they took the demonstration on to the thoroughfare, which they blocked for over an hour. The blockade was finally removed a little before 4pm after the state education minister intervened and called a group of agitating students to his home and listen to their demands,” said a senior Kolkata Police officer. A similar protest was staged by students at Gurudas College in Phoolbagan over the same issue. The first-year BCom students at Sir Gurudas Mahavidyalaya at Muraripukur claimed senior members of the college union, run by the ruling party students’ wing, had allegedly told them they had to attend only a handful of classes and the rest, they would manage. The union representatives, however, denied the claim. At South City, the unrest started brewing on Thursday, when the students were first intimated about poor attendance of a majority of the accountancy students, who laid siege to the principal’s office soon after. “However, I didn’t call the police or let the matter escalate. I tried to convince the students that this was the university guideline. But later at night, the minister in charge called me to know about the problem and advised me to get police posting at the college on Friday. The cops helped keep the agitating students outside the college, but they took the demonstration to the road, harassing commuters. I have asked for police deployment for Saturday as well, internal exams are on,” said Nabanita Chakraborty, college principal. Several among the protesters claimed they were confident of having attained the necessary attendance and accused the authorities of being corrupt. There were others, who rather brazenly said they did not realize the college would be so strict as classes started only in August, following by the Puja vacation. “I am certain I have over 60% attendance. A teacher has told me I have 74% attendance but still, my name is on the list. But some students who never attend classes are being allowed for the exam,” said Doyel Mondal, a firstyear BCom student. Her friend, Ajay Kundu, claimed the professors would jot down attendance on a piece of paper and seldom brought the register. “The teachers did not carry out their duty properly. Since this is our first year, we should be allowed a little grace,” he said. But after the college authorities refused to meet them, in spite of waiting outside the gate from 11am till 2.30pm, the students apparently “grew desperate and blocked the Golpark crossing”. They hurled guardrails and stones at the passing vehicles and some banged on the cars trying to manoeuvre their way past the agitators, while cops reportedly looked on. The mayhem shut down the entire Golpark crossing around 2.40pm, forcing several commuters, including elderly headed to hospitals to youngsters returning from school, to walk to their destinations. Actordirector-singer Anjan Dutta, too, was stuck in the snarl. But people, such as Uber driver Vijay Shah, suffered the most as the students attacked him and vandalized his car as he tried to pick up a passenger from near Golpark. “My windscreen was damaged and they tried to drag me out. I don’t even know what they were protesting against,” he said.2The blockade was lifted around 3.50pm after a senior police officer told students that education minister Partha Chatterjee would meet five of them at his home to discuss the issue. None was arrested till late on Friday as no complaint was lodged, cops said.',\n",

Muraleedharan, after visiting the BJP state general secretary K Surendran in jail here on Friday, told reporters that he did not think that the present state president would go for a compromise. He said it was upto the state unit of the party to decide on the course of action in the agitation. The former state president of the party said there can be no relaxation in the struggle to protect faith and practices in Sabarimala. \"We will not allow the attempt to isolate and hunt Surendran. There was a doubt that the chief minister\\'s office was behind framing false cases against him. The chief minister\\'s recent remarks have established that the cases were slapped on Surendran following the instruction from the CM,\" he said. BJP state vice-president Chettoor Balakrishnan and former state spokesperson P Raghunath accompanied Muraleedharan to the jail. Surendran was produced before the judicial first-class magistrate (7) as there are two cases against against him-one for taking out a march to the office of the district police chief (Kozhikde City) and the related to blocking train as part of agitation. He was granted bail in both cases. Meanwhile, party state president P S Sreedharan Pillai has stated that the party will approach the high court against illegal detention of Surendran. Inaugurating the BJP leaders\\' meet here on Friday, he said if needed the service of senior lawyers from Supreme Court will be availed. \"The party will marshal all its organizational strength to resist the move against Surendran and other Ayyappa devotees,\" he said. Pillai said the third phase of the Sabarimla agitation of the party will begin in front of secretariat on Monday with BJP general secretary A N Radhakrishnan sitting on a hunger strike. The results of the elections to the local bodies in the state that were announced on Friday have given hopes to the BJP. The party has succeeded in fetching two seats in Alappuzha, Pillai said.',\n",
       " 'KOCHI: A tribal community at Vanchivayal in Vallakadavu range of Periyar Tiger Reserve - who avoided middlemen for the past two decades while auctioning their organically-grown green pepper to exporters - is planning to export coffee and turmeric to overseas markets, including Europe. Vanchivayal\\'s farming community can be reached only after a 4km trek into the reserve forest and the residents are no ordinary tribesmen; all 73 households have been practicing organic farming and have soil health cards. \"During the past 19 years, we had been exporting organic pepper either directly or through those with export licences. Now, we are planning to add coffee and turmeric to the export basket,\" said PN Sebastian, a facilitator for the pepper auctioning project. The practice, which started almost two decades ago, helps them fetch better prices than the prevailing daily market price. Much of their produce finds its way to Europe, thanks to the business connections they have forged over the years. Compared to Kochi prices of normal black pepper, the organic, green pepper of Vanchivayal fetches 12-40% higher prices. \"During the past 10 years, the price differential never went below 22%,\" said Sebastian. While pepper prices declined rapidly across the globe, the process ensures a fair price to them. Every year, at the end of November, tribesmen advertise an estimated size of produce (25 tonnes this year) in newspapers and firms with export licence attend the auction in the second week of December. The whole auctioning process is done through eco development committee (EDC) set up with tribesmen as members. Earlier, it was difficult for tribesmen within the reserve to get a fair price. \"To address this issue, the then deputy director of Project Tiger Pramod G Krishnan had set up an EDC for Vanchivayal. The idea was to cut out middlemen and do business with pepper processors in Kochi,\" Sebastian said. Also, there were other committees acting on other programmes like adventure trekking; Vanchivayal one is one among them. Initially, committees were formed with forest department officials and NGOs as members. Sometime ago, EDC got in touch with Ecoland Herbs and Spices in Germany and even tried exporting directly to Europe. \"The cost was high, we incurred losses and dropped the idea and continued auctioning pepper to local exporters,\" he said.',\n",

The police had learnt that the accused were on their way from Shil Phata to Mumbra. The car in which the accused had come was intercepted by the police who conducted a physical check which led to the recovery of a buckskin and a huge stock of antlers.

       " 'Lucknow: The engineering students of Babasaheb Bhirmrao Ambedkar University (BBAU) turned violent and vandalised property on the campus after their demand to postpone the examinations was rejected by the University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET) director Prof Kaman Singh on Friday. Three students, including a girl, were injured. On Friday, about 60 engineering students met Kaman Singh and demanded their examinations scheduled from December 7 be postponed by a month as the syllabus in most of the subjects was incomplete. When the UIET director refused to accept the demand, the students raised slogans and got into a heated argument with him. Prof Singh then allegedly slapped a student. Thereafter, the students went on a rampage — broke the window panes and damaged the university property. “How can they conduct the examinations when the course is incomplete. We were only demanding the postponement of examinations but the director slapped me,” said BTech student Prabhat. He said the vice-chancellor had assured them that the examinations will not be held unless the syllabus was completed. “We have also been demanding the removal of Prof Kaman Singh because he is from the chemistry department and doesn’t have any idea about the engineering department. Instead of listening to students, he slapped and abused students,” said PhD student Abhishek Mishra who was present when the incident took place. Prof Singh denied slapping any student and said that some rowdy elements, who were not from the engineering department, had instigated the students for violence. “I have written to the proctor board to file an FIR against eight students involved in the incident. These students have intentionally made an attempt to disturb peace on the campus,” he said. He, however, said that considering the students’ demand, BBAU will conduct exams of only those engineering subjects from December 7 whose syllabus is complete. The remaining papers will be held a week later, he added.',\n",
       " 'KOLKATA: City police’s Facebook appeal for crowdfunding a rehabilitation project for criminals with addiction — Project Shuddhi — had earlier received a warm response and now, the actual benefits are getting visible, claimed cops. Not only have the cops tied up with three private companies — one an auto manufacturing giant, the other makes LED lights and the third one from Bankura — to induct around 35 of the 85 reformed criminals, there are also efforts to try and employ them as full-time drivers and civic cops. But the real achievement, cops feel, has been a slide in the crime rate. Across Kolkata, around 120 odd house thefts got reported a year ago. The number has come down to around 55 a month now. Similarly, car thefts have witnessed a sharp fall — from a high of 70-75 to 20-22 a month now. “While we have registered the sharp drop through meticulously planned investigations, we found Shuddhi an important tool. So far, 85 petty criminals have reformed themselves and have being declared free of drug abuse. We are organizing job fairs where we are expecting at least 10-15 to land a job. We have begun training them in various vocational courses,” said an officer, who is a part of the project. Earlier, the Kolkata Police Facebook appeal for crowdfunding Project Shuddhi has received an overwhelming response. The respondents included Sonika 27 Foundation, the NGO set up by relatives and friends of model Sonika Singh Chauhan, who died in a car crash on Rashbehari Avenue last year. The foundation agreed to fund the rehabilitation of five such men. Since the project has been launched, around a hundred individuals, NGOs and corporates have enrolled themselves as sponsors.',\n",

       " 'MUMBAI: Central Railway seems to have finally taken care of some monkey business near Khandala. To tide over the constant train disruptions at Monkey Hill due to simians clambering up poles and tripping power lines, CR has created a “trap” that will not let the animals reach the wires. On an average, monkeys bring train services to a halt on the stretch at least thrice a month.  “Monkey Hill is a tricky route as trains have to manoeuvre a steep incline to reach Pune. So steep is the incline that apart from the front engine, another locomotive has to be attached to the rear-end of the train to provide enough traction to climb over the ghat section,” said a senior CR officer. And for years, monkeys have been climbing railway poles here, swinging on the Over Head Equipment (OHE) wires, causing the entire power line to trip. “The trickier part is that once a train halts on the incline, it is not possible to move it even if power is restored. Another locomotive has to be sent to be attached to the rear engine to give the push to the train,” added the officer. Now, CR officials have ingeniously developed a trap which will prevent monkeys from climbing the OHE poles. “The 5ft-long trap is cylindrical in shape and its circumference large enough to allow a monkey to pass through it. It has a barricade on top which will ensure the monkey does not reach the wires,” said another official, adding that the light-weight aluminium trap is not heavy and hence there will be no load on the OHE mast. “A monkey can enter the trap but it will not be able to come out due to the barricade above. As, there are no handles or holes inside, the simians will not find a grip and will have to climb down,” he said CR has already installed the traps on some of the OHE poles on the stretch and soon, all the poles will be covered. Officials said this was much-needed as restoring services after power disruptions is an uphill task. “The driver and the guard have to alight and meet at a middle point to match the time and then “push and pull” the front and rear engine to restart the train. It is a timeconsuming process and takes almost two-three hours to restart the service,” he added.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: Even as the state government has claimed that infant mortality and child mortality cases are on the decline, this year, till July, 93,783 children have been diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition and 5.7 lakh with moderate acute malnutrition.  According to the written reply submitted by the women and child department in the legislative council on Friday, in July, 58.8 lakh children were examined for weight of which 52.2 of them were found to be \\'normal\\'. The remaining children were in different malnutrition categories. The question regarding child and infant mortality was raised by NCP\\'s Jagannath Shinde, who claimed despite schemes run by the state government, these deaths are yet to be curbed. Replying to the question, state minister for women and child development Pankaja Munde said her department, along with the public health department, was doing a \\'very good job\\' in reducing the number of child and infant deaths. \"In 2003, there were 5,415 child mortality cases, while this year, there were 950, so far. Our policies are working and the convergence of the health department and women and child development department schemes has yielded good results,\" she said. She added that Maharashtra is ranked third in reducing infant mortality rate, after Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In Maharashtra, the infant mortality rate in 2003 was 45, which had been brought down to 19 in 2018. \"There has been a 60% reduction in such deaths.\" Munde said public perception is that infant mortality is only linked with malnourishment, which is not true. \"There are several reasons like premature delivery, congenial anomalies, sepsis and pneumonia. We are also working to ensure a healthy diet for expecting mothers,\" she said. When Shinde pointed out that areas like Palghar and Melghat are still the epicentre of infant mortality, Munde said such deaths in these areas too have dropped. In 2017, 302 children died in Palghar and 242 in Melghat, while in 2018, till July, the numbers stood at 102 and 208 respectively.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: A special CBI court convicted former coal secretary H C Gupta and two other senior IAS officers on Friday for corruption in the allocation of a coal block in West Bengal, a development which will cause considerable heartburn among the bureaucratic fraternity which laments that it is left to carry the can for carrying out the orders of the regime of the day, and revives memories of the Coalgate scam. Two other bureaucrats convicted by CBI judge Bharat Parashar are K S Kropha, then a joint secretary in the ministry of coal who superannuated as chief secretary of Meghalaya, and K C Samria, then a director in the ministry of coal who is currently joint secretary in the ministry of minority affairs. They have been convicted of cheating, criminal conspiracy and corruption under provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act in the allocation of Moira- Madhujore coal block in West Bengal for captive use of a private company — M/s VMPL — and can be sentenced for up to seven years in prison. Importantly, the CBI had moved for a “closure” of this case. The convicts, who include Vikas Patni and Anand Mallick, managing director and authorised signatory of M/s VMPL, respectively, were sent to judicial custody till December 3 when the court will hear arguments on the quantum of sentence. Gupta was earlier convicted in two other cases of coal block allocation in which he has been sentenced to jail for two and three years, respectively. He is out on bail in both the cases. The convictions revived the memories of the Rs 1.86-lakh-crore “Coalgate scam”, which, along with another alleged mega swindle of the UPA-era, the spectrum scam, massively contributed to Congress’ rout by the Narendra Modi-led BJP. Gupta has a solid reputation for integrity and had, anguished by the prosecution, once thought of not defending himself. His conviction along with two of his former juniors is sure to reinforce the angst of bureaucrats over becoming collateral victims of the shenanigans of the executive. As a matter of fact, unrest over his prosecution and the fear that it might deter bureaucrats from taking decisions had led the Modi government to change the anti-corruption law to buffer officials against prosecution for decisions taken in good faith. Now, prosecution sanction is required both for serving and retired government officers. Earlier it was not applicable to retired officers. Section 13 of the amended act also says that a public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct if he intentionally enriches himself illicitly during the period of his office. Earlier, even if no pecuniary benefit was received by a public servant, s/he could still be penalised. In its 467-page order, the court observed that the application of M/s VMPL seeking allocation of a coal block was clearly incomplete in terms of the guidelines issued by the coal ministry and should have been rejected. “These circumstances thus once again show as to how casual and perfunctory was the working of MOC at all levels in the coal block allocation process,” judge Parashar said. He also took exception to the CBI’s move to drop the prosecution of Gupta and others by seeking closure of some cases linked to “Coalgate” and said it would be appropriate that a copy was sent to the CBI director. “I also intend to express my sincere concern about the nature of the investigation being carried out by the CBI in various coal block allocation matters,” said the judge. In his order, he also stressed that the trial had stumbled upon a “disturbing feature” where one of the defence counsel highlighted that the CBI was selective in deciding whom to prosecute, focusing only on the officers of coal ministry. Without commenting on the veracity of the lawyer’s observation, Parashar observed, “If there is any iota of truth in the said submissions then the same speaks volumes about the conduct of the officers of the CBI.” He also expressed concern that the opinion of CBI officers and conclusions of investigations in other coal block allocation matters where no final report has been filed was being shared with outsiders in violation of a Supreme Court order of 2013 directing the agency to “ensure secrecy of investigations”.',\n",

       " 'Ludhiana: A man, who had tried to murder his wife by first pouring acid on her and inflicting knife injuries on her neck, has been sentenced to 10-year rigorous imprisonment by a sessions court in Ludhiana. The court of additional sessions judge Jagdeep Kaur Virk also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the convict, Ravi Kumar, and in case he is unable to pay the fine, he would have to undergo simple imprisonment for another year. Out of the total amount, Rs 50,000 will be paid to the victim as compensation. The incident had happened on February 28, 2017, when the victim, Ranjana Devi, was sleeping in her house at Baba Namdev Colony. It was 3am, when her husband had woken her up and unleashed a brutal attack on her. He had first thrashed her and then poured acid on her. As if it was enough, Ravi even tried to slit her throat with a knife. Unable to bear anymore pain, Ranjana had fallen unconscious. Later, she had found herself dumped in a forest in a village, known to her father Suraj Bhan. On March 3, 2017, Meharban police had booked Ravi under Section 307 (attempt to murder), 326 A (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid), 498 A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of IPC. Ravi was arrested on March 4, 2017. Police also recovered a knife on the basis of information provided by the assailant. It later presented a challan in the case in the court. During the trial, Ravi had pleaded that the case was false. To prove the allegations, the additional public prosecutor had referred to the testimony of the victim who had deposed that her husband mentally and physically harassed her for dowry since their marriage in 2014. Ranjana’s father Suraj Bhan deposed that his daughter had been living in constant fear and tension as the accused used to beat her up often and did not even allow her to talk to him over the phone. Krishan Lal and his wife of a village where she was found in the forest also deposed in the case. Medical officers of the civil hospital, who had examined her, also recorded their statements in the case. The defence counsel had contended that Ravi was innocent and falsely implicated. According to the counsel, Ranjana had left her home after leaving her three-month-old child alone at home at 3pm on February 28, 2017 in the presence of residents of locality. Thereafter, Ranjana went missing and could not be traced. Her husband had orally informed Meharban police station about his missing wife on same day and had lodged the missing report of his wife in the same police station the next day. The court observed the ocular evidence of the victim is duly corroborated with the medical evidence, so there is no question to disbelieve that burn injuries on the neck and chest of the victim was caused by any other substance than acid or any other person than her husband. The court held the defence counsel’s contention that the assailant had inflicted no knife injury on the victim’s neck. The court also observed that the version of victim that her husband used to harass her on the pretext of bringing Rs 1 lakh for the purchase of plot or on the pretext of dowry had not been sufficiently proved. The court held the convict guilty under Section 326 A of IPC, keeping in view the impact of acid attack on the victim’s social, economic and personal life and the age, antecedents and character of the convict, gravity and nature of offence. Dowry demand Her husband Ravi had been demanding Rs 1 lakh from her. He told her to bring the money from her father, failing which he would kill her, the victim had said.

Meanwhile, the meteorological department predicted fog in the morning and evening hours for the next four to five days. “The high humidity (70-80%) in the morning, night temperature below 10°C and clear sky were the reasons for fog in and around Ludhiana. It is likely to continue in the morning and evening hours in the next four to five days. Whereas the visibility in the morning is likely to remain around 200m, it might be below 1,000m in the evening hours,” Surender Paul, director, meteorological department, Chandigarh. “Those driving vehicles should take precautions while driving,” said Surender.

       " 'KOZHIKODE: Conservationists are gearing up for the first synchronised vulture survey covering four South Indian states in February 2019. The maiden survey of the critically endangered vulture populations will be conducted by the Vulture Conservation Working Group- South India (VCWG-SI), in association with the state forest departments over a two-day period. \"The vulture survey is an attempt to get the exact count of the endangered birds in South India. Previously, surveys were held in individual landscapes, but as the birds can fly more than 100km a day, there are chances of duplication. The synchronised survey will be held in all the four states during same dates using a uniform protocol,\" conservation biologist C K Vishnudas, a member of the VCWG-SI said. He said the lone breeding population of critically endangered vulture species in the state in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) was stable with around 50 individuals comprising White-rumped vultures (Gyps bengalensis) and around ten Red-headed vultures (Sarcogyps calvus). The other main vulture species found in South Indian habitats are the Long- billed vulture (Gyps indicus) and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus). The reclusive Cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) and Himalayan griffon vulture, have also been spotted as stragglers in the WWS. The meeting of the Vulture Conservation Working Group held recently at the Bandipur Tiger Reserve also decided to work towards bringing in a regulation across South India to control the use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and other similar veterinary drugs that are harmful to vultures. The veterinary use of the drug diclofenac has been linked to the collapse of vulture population in the country since the 1990s after the birds ate cattle carcasses containing the drug. \"Though diclofenac was banned for veterinary use in 2006, it has been found that other drugs like aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, which are harmful to vultures, are available near many vulture habitats. The vulture conservation blue print also focuses on persuading the state veterinary departments and drug department to prohibit veterinary use of such drugs and instead promote vulture-safe drugs like meloxicam,\" Vishnudas added.',\n",

       " 'Ludhiana: In order to check the wrong practice among city residents of avoiding completion certificates after the construction of a building as per the approved building plan, the recently notified building bylaws have mooted a ban on issuing water supply, electricity, and sewerage connection before the completion of a building. So, residents will now get only a temporary water connection, but regular connection will be given only when people show the completion of a building by fulfilling all requirements. This practice will ensure the installation of fire safety arrangements, as well as rainwater harvesting system in the building. As per MC records, around 5,313 applications were received for building plan approval since April 2015 until the end of March 31 this year in all the four zones. However, they received only 168 applications for the completion certificate. Though a completion certificate is necessary to obtain, residents are hardly bothered about it, due to MC’s laxity in checking and giving water supply and sewerage connections. Violations of building bylaws often take place when people do not apply for a completion certificate. A civic official claimed that in the new bylaws notified recently, it is mentioned that the NOC for regular water supply and electricity should be issued only after the completion certificate is obtained. He further explained that the temporary connection for water, electricity, and sewerage — permitted for the purpose of facilitating construction — should not be allowed to continue without obtaining a completion certificate. “No building should be connected to a sewer line without prior permission of the authority, and without obtaining a completion certificate,” he said. Assistant town planner (headquarters) SS Bindra said: “It is the duty of residents to apply for completion certificates, but most of the time people do not construct a building on the basis of an approved plan, and so they do not come for a completion certificate.” He said lack of staff in MC does not allow them to visit every building for checking, but if the condition of a completion certificate is applied strictly, it would become mandatory for residents to obtain one. WHAT IS IT? The completion certificate is a kind of NOC issued by MC after a construction gets completed, and a final checking is conducted by officials to certify that the applicant has followed all the building bylaws. With this practice, fire arrangements as well as rainwater harvesting system can be ensured in all buildings.',\n",

Papneet will soon get an appointment letter for judicial magistrate first class. During the first year, she will undergo regular training. Belonging to Jalalabad in Ferozepur district, her family shifted to Ludhiana in 2010 for her education. She took coaching for three years to crack the judicial exams, and this was her first attempt. She had appeared for her prelims exam last year, while her mains exam was in September this year, and interview in November. She was excited about her results and said: “I had always admired the judiciary, as this is the only field that delivers justice to people. Becoming a part of this profession nurtured my ambition, and I started preparing for the tough exams.” Giving the credit of her success to her teacher and family members, she said: “My teacher Vikas Kaushal, my parents, and brothers motivated me a lot. I owe my success to them. My family used to skip family functions when my exams started approaching.” Sharing her success mantra, Papneet said: “I used to study for only five hours a day. My day started with maintaining schedules of the portions I wanted to do that day.” An alumnus of Guru Nanak Khalsa College for Women, Gujjarkhan Campus, Model Town, Papneet is a gold medallist in both her degrees — BBA and LLB.

       " 'Ludhiana: Two days after a woman allegedly kidnapped a 2-month-old boy from the Focal point area, cops have got no clue about the child-lifter, who was otherwise identified through a CCTV footage on Thursday. Her picture, which was captured in the CCTV camera, has been circulated to the police stations in other districts. The woman had kidnapped Sandeep, son of labourer Shyam Babu who stayed in labour quarters in Focal Point. Police had registered a case of kidnapping, following a complaint from child’s mother Poonam. Police suspected that the woman might be a part of an organised gang of child traffickers. Cops said the way the woman befriended infant’s mother, got familiar with the child and then escaped with baby suggests she was part of a child traffickers’ gang. “We suspect that the woman has left the city, fearing that the boy’s mother and their neighbours could easily recognize her. The police have circulated pictures with police of other districts to trace them,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (IV) Rajbeer Singh Boparai. Meanwhile, Sandeep’s mother remained in a state of shock, who continued to blame herself for handing over her son to the woman. Sandeep’s father Shyam Babu said, “My wife has been crying since the woman took our child away. She is inconsolable and worried about his health.” The woman who had come to Babu’s locality on the pretext of living in a rented accommodation had not even disclosed her name to his wife and other women in the area, he claimed. “She only disclosed that she had come from Sahnewal area and had come to live in the locality with her husband. She developed a rapport with our kids,” he said. A day before the kidnapping, the accused had befriended the women in the area after paying an advance sum of Rs 500 for the rented accommodation where she had come to stay. “When she came that day, she told everyone that she would shift here on December 1. She got the room cleaned, pretending that she would soon come to stay. After accompanying Poonam to the hospital, the accused kept asking her to accompany her to the market,” he added. Poonam shared, “I kept asking her that I cannot leave my children at home. Then she said that she would carry a child. I was carrying Sandeep while she was carrying my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. She was purchasing blankets and I stated helping her. Meanwhile my daughter started crying. After this she handed over my daughter and took my son in lap. Within seconds, the woman escaped with my son.”',\n",

       " 'HYDERABAD: Even as sharp differences have come out in the open between Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu over the latter attending the foundation-laying ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor, the Punjab minister claimed in Hyderabad on Friday that it was Congress president Rahul Gandhi who had sent him to Pakistan. Sidhu, who was here to campaign for Congress in the Telangana elections, also claimed before reporters that Rahul as well as senior party leaders had “patted me on the back” for going to Pakistan. TOI had carried a report on November 28 quoting Amarinder as saying that he had asked Sidhu to reconsider his decision to visit Pakistan for the ceremony. However, when asked if he had pleased one ‘captain’ (Pakistan PM Imran Khan) while displeasing another (Amarinder), Sidhu said: “Rahul Gandhi is my captain. It is he who sent me to Pakistan. Rahul is the captain of the captain (Amarinder) also.” “There are many leaders in the party and I got a pat on my back from Harish Rawat, (Randeep) Surjewala, Shashi Tharoor and Rahulji,” he said, adding that he had gone to Pakistan earlier as well. “And I would go there again for the sake of the people.” Opposition leaders had criticised Sidhu after his Pakistan trip for going overboard with his show of affection there. He had agreed to visit Pakistan even after PM Modi refused to go there for the Saarc summit. He even called Imran his “yaar dildar”. To Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s allegations that Sidhu was getting more love in Pakistan and that even Imran had stated Sidhu would win if he contested an election in Pakistan, he said, “What Imran meant was that people love him in Pakistan and so was the case back home. I have won six elections which is not possible without the love and affection of the people. Ask her (Harsimrat) how many polls has she won?” On his participation in the Kartarpur corridor ceremony, he sought to claim credit for creating a bridge between the two countries. “People know the result of my visit but when her Baba (ex-CM Parkash Singh Badal) went there, he came back with sheep.” On his photograph with Gopal Singh Chawla, Sidhu said: “Ten to 10,000 people were coming to take photographs and selfies with me in Pakistan. How would I know who is Chawla or Pawla. Moreover, why would someone knowingly take a photograph with Chawla in public on the road?”',\n",

       " 'Ludhiana: Even as the lifting of stray cattle through another cowshed had been finalized in an MC general house meeting on September 4, civic officials could not begin the process so far. Earlier, officials were waiting for a nod from the local bodies department, but now the cowshed management has not come forward to sign the agreement with MC. As a result, residents and commuters in the city continue to suffer the menace of stray cattle roaming the city roads at will. The number of stray cattle roaming on the city roads is increasing with each passing day, due to which commuters face many problems while driving. They feared that in the coming foggy season, stray cattle could also become a cause of accidents, so authorities should take the menace seriously. In the MC general house meeting on September 4, house members had given sanction to hire Prachin Gaushala Part 2 on Tibba Road for lifting stray cattle. This resolution was approved by the local bodies department, and MC was allowed to tie up with the second cowshed, as one cowshed — Govind Godham — was already working for MC since 2010. The MC pays Rs30 per cattle as maintenance fee to the cowshed management. As of now, there are 1,369 cattle being managed by Govind Godham. The cow cess, being recovered through various sources, is meant to manage stray cattle. Shivpuri resident Satpal Ahuja complained: “Traffic rules are meant for human beings, not animals, so we cannot say anything to them when they sit in the middle of the road, except wait for them to move aside.” He said authorities should actually do something about these roaming animals. Iqbal Ganj resident Pankaj Garg said: “Residents are equally responsible for this menace, as they continue providing food to animals, and then these animals do not move from that place afterwards. Residents should change their habits.” Meanwhile, senior veterinary officer Dr YP Singh said: “I had contacted the cowshed management members for signing the agreement, but they have sought a few days, so lifting of animals can begin only after they sign the agreement with MC.” Notably, stray cattle are visible on roads like GT Road, Jalandhar Bypass, Haibowal, Hambran Road, Chandigarh Road, Bus Stand Road, Daresi, and even posh areas like Model Town and BRS Nagar. The stretches and bridges along Buddha Nullah have also become a haven for these stray cattle. Now, they can even be seen on flyovers. MC had purchased a cattle lifting van in March to increase the pace of lifting, but they could not bring the van on the road even once. Earlier, the local bodies department had expressed doubts over the purchase of the van, and when they received the approval, then objection was raised on the appointment of staff for the van.',\n",

Gosha also supported the recently raided businessmen by claiming they had been paying their taxes honestly. “The raids being conducted by the investigation wing against the city’s businessmen, including those belonging to the real estate sector and hosiery industry, are nothing less than government-sponsored terrorism. If these atrocities by the department against the business community do not end, SAD will hit the roads along with the businessmen, and a massive agitation will be launched,” he said. Gosha also said that instead of giving relief to businessmen whose businesses have suffered due to several reasons, including a slump, the I-T department was hell bent on getting these businesses closed permanently. “What could be worse is that the department is targeting those businessmen who have earned their money honestly, and have been paying their taxes honestly. It is a warning to the department and its officials that if this terrorism of raids, surveys, and checking does not end now, we — along with the protests — will publicly name and shame the corrupt officers of the department,” he said.

But apart from change in gender in some words and tweaks here and there, it comes across as a rip-off of the work by young poet S Kalesh, first published in 2011 in his blog and later as part of the book \\'Sabdamahasamudram\\' in 2015. Even the title is similar: \\'Anganeyirikke marichu poyi njan/nee\\'. \"I thought it was a trick played by someone to defame her.

The law department has accepted his resignation.  Unhappy with Nikam’s resignation, Bhambani’s daughter Sonia has written to the CM, DGP, and the Bombay HC expressing anger over the way her father’s case is being handled. TOI has a copy of the letter. “It is a painful fact that we are now in November 2018, nearly three years to the date of murder, and there is absolutely no trace of justice in sight. Sad to hear that senior public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam has quit the case. Given how the case has progressed with no movement due to umpteen bail and discharge applications being heard over the past few years, which all were denied, is it normal for a famed lawyer to be making such a decision around the time when it seems that the case may have its first regular hearing in a year. We strongly suspect foul play,” reads the letter. Sonia has asked in the letter whether it is normal for a PP to to walk out of a case for such frivolous reasons? “We feel someone from the police department has forced Nikam to quit. We have waited for long because we are decent people, waiting patiently for judicial system and police force to deliver results. However, as time is passing, we cannot help but notice the dwindling motivation towards this case on the part of the powers that be. We urge you to put yourself in our shoes and understand the sheer sense of pain, injustice and helplessness that we feel and have felt for three years,” the letter states. Hirani, an artist, and Bhambhani were found dead in a nallah in Kandivli (W) on December 12, 2015. The police initially arrested four workers for murdering the two at Hirani’s workshop and then disposing of their bodies. Later, the police arrested Hirani’s estranged husband Chintan Upadhyay and charged him with conspiracy to murder. Upadhyay is currently in judicial custody. In 2016, the government appointed Nikam as special public prosecutor. Hirani’s friend Sanchu Menon said, “The main accused, Vidhyadar Rajbhar, has still not been caught, then the case was transferred from Kandivli to crime branch unit 11, and later to crime branch unit 7, and now this.

       " 'BENGALURU: SAP is establishing a large new campus in Bengaluru near the international airport, which will significantly increase its R&D (research & development) presence in the city. The company’s executive board member Bernd Leukert, who is in charge of products & innovation, and who was in Bengaluru on Friday to mark the company’s 20th anniversary in India, said it would be a 40-acre campus, double the size of the existing one in Whitefield. The company had a ground-breaking ceremony on Thursday. SAP Labs India managing director Dilipkumar Khandelwal said construction would start as soon as the government approves the building plans. “It’s a testimonial to the great talent and abilities here, and the extent to which people here have contributed to the overall success of SAP,” Leukert said. SAP has 11,000 employees in India, of which 7,500 are in core R&D, making it the German enterprise software company’s second largest R&D centre in the world. The new campus will likely further strengthen India’s role globally. SAP’s worldwide R&D headcount is about 27,000. Asked how many people the company expects to hire in the coming years, Leukert and Khandelwal declined to provide a figure. But Khandelwal noted that the company hired over 1,000 people in each of the past five years. Leukert said SAP sees India as one of the massive growth opportunities. “We have said we are looking at tripling our market capitalisation, and this goes with the investment we are planning across the company, and India is one of the huge growth opportunities. Otherwise we would not have bought land double the size of what we have,” he said. On the nature of hiring, Khandelwal said the company focused on lateral hiring earlier, but over the past few years, it has been ensuring that at least 50% of new hires are from college campuses. This, he said, gives the company a good mix of experience and youngsters who are more agile and savvy with new technology. He also said traditionally the company looked for BE and BTech talent, but increasingly it is focusing on getting people with industry knowledge, in order to be able to design full products for industries. In its early years, the India centre customised for the domestic market. It then started contributing to the development of global products. Since 2011-12, it started moving entire responsibilities. “Today, it has become such a strategic location that no SAP product goes without an India footprint. There’s more and more product ownership here, entire architectures are built out of here,” Khandelwal said. Khandelwal is also responsible globally for SAP’s Hana enterprise cloud business. “I sit out of here. Such a profile never existed in India before. It’s (Hana enterprise cloud) close to a $800 million business. Those earchitects sitting to transform a customer from an offline to a cloud world, it’s all happening here,” he said. Leukert said at least two of the products developed out of India – the Fashion Management solution and the Asset Intelligence Network – have had far-reaching effects. The first involved bringing many of the world’s biggest fashion brands, including Armani and Luxottica, together to understand how their requirements had changed, and then developing an appropriate solution. The fashion market earlier had only a summer season and a winter season. Now, there are in-season changes, which means there’s need for instant feedback when a product is introduced, and if necessary do quick refinements. This in turn requires better planning and management of fabric and other materials. E-commerce and individualised products have also dramatically changed the industry. “All these elements were incorporated in this (Fashion Management) product. It is now the default solution for how fashion companies steer their business,” Leukert said. The Asset Intelligence Network identifies problems in running products before they occur through remote diagnostics. This helps a service technician to, say, replace a part before a breakdown. “The Italian railways is using it. In the first year, they saved 10% of their maintenance costs in the trains in which they implemented it. Once they implement in all, they’ll save some 100 million euro annually. Gartner is using it as a case study,” Leukert said.',\n",
       " 'KANNUR: Forget preaching pseudo morality. Targeted interventions among female sex workers and MSM (men who have sex with men) seem to be more helpful in preventing spread of AIDS. Most sex workers have now started engaging in sex with a limited number of clients and that too with only those who are personally known to them, according to people working among such communities. NGOs working among sex workers said the clients are also ready to undergo frequent medical check-ups. \"Nowadays, not many of them are seen on the streets. They work during daytime and meet only a limited number of clients who are known to them,\" said Shaji P M, coordinator of Chola, a Kannur-based NGO. Since the sex workers know most of their clients, they make sure that the ones who come to them undergo medical check-ups for HIV and other infections, he said. There are 749 female sex workers in contact with Chola and nearly 80% of them practice such methods, he said, adding there were 12 HIV-infected sex workers here a few years ago but none of them are working in the sex industry now. With the advent of smartphones and social media, the coordination has become easy for them and it has reduced the risk. According to Snehatheeram, another NGO, sexual minorities, including members of the MSM community, have also been following such methods . In the MSM community, there are people from all classes and now most of them indulge in sexual activity with known partners and it has reduced the risk of HIV infection, said an employee of the NGO. Thanks to such interventions initiated by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), with the support of the NGOs, the risk of HIV infection has come down considerably, said Dennis Joseph, joint director of the society. \"The spread of HIV among sex workers has been reduced from 1.75% nearly a decade back to 0.01% now,\" he said. Last year, only four cases of HIV infection were reported among the sex workers in the state, and only two of them were registered with KSACS and two were outsiders, said KSACS. Similar interventions were made among drug users which helped them curb the habit of sharing syringes. Moreover, after realizing that they resort to crime to get money to procure drugs, facility was provided to get them drug, as part of the treatment, he said. As a result, the prevalence of HIV infection rate among drug abusers has come down from 10.5% to 0.41% in the past one decade, said the KSACS joint director.',\n",

The initiative, including the open-wells project, is being executed by rainwater harvesting expert S Vishwanath of BIOME, Ramprasad of Friends of Lakes and the India Cares Foundation. Ramprasad said the aim is to maintain the groundwater level in Cubbon Park, thereby ensuring that the three ponds on the premises are alive. “Each recharge well will be 15ft-20ft deep so that rainwater can be pushed as deep as possible. Another crucial part of the project is involving grave-diggers from the traditional Bovi community so that they get a livelihood,” he added. ‘Park can meet its water needs’ A senior official from the department said as per estimates, 50 wells in the park would help harvest about 10 lakh litres of water every monsoon. Once the project is over, the park can meet its water needs, he added. Ramprasad said the project will also encourage people to join their “million recharge wells” campaign aimed at taking citizens’ relationship with groundwater beyond using borewells and digging new ones. It’s objective is to reconnect people with open-well heritage.',\n",
       " 'HYDERABAD: After being in political oblivion for close to two decades, former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin was on Friday appointed as working president of the Congress party in Telangana. Soon after assuming charge, Azhar said he was keen to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Secunderabad. With less than a week to go for the assembly polls, Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s move is being seen as an attempt to attract Muslim votes in the state. It is also a move to pacify the former skipper, who had been sulking after not getting any role in the assembly elections. Muslims constitute about 14% of the state’s population and can play a key role in about 40 seats in the 119-seat assembly. “I have been given a good post after 18 years. I am very happy,” said the former Moradabad MP. Azharuddin becomes the fourth working president in the Telangana Congress along with A Revanth Reddy, Ponnam Prabhakar and J Kusum Kumar. The party has done a delicate balancing act with Revanth being a popular Reddy leader, Prabhakar representing the large BC community and Kumar representing the Kammas. The Secunderabad seat that Azhar is eyeing is held by BJP’s Bandaru Dattatreya. While BJP is likely to field a new face from the seat this time, sources said Azharuddin would struggle to get the ticket for the prestigious seat as many aspirants are in the fray. While he did say that he would abide by the party’s decision, Azhar made it clear that Secunderabad was on top of his wish list. “My house falls under the constituency. I want to serve the people there,” he said.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Businessman Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, had failed to appear before the Enforcement Directorate on the first summons issued to him in early November in connection with his Sky Light Hospitality’s land deals in Bikaner. The agency is likely to issue another summons to Vadra in a money laundering case it is investigating in connection with Sky Light Hospitality Pvt Ltd, said a source. The ED registered a money laundering case in September 2015 in the Bikaner land deal case based on a Rajasthan police FIR and 20 chargesheets filed by the state force. The Rajasthan police filed cases against Sky Light Hospitality and others in August 2014, soon after the NDA government assumed office at the Centre. In December 2017, the ED had arrested two persons in the Bikaner land scam, Jaiprakash Bagarwa and Ashok Kumar. The latter, according to the ED, is a close associate of Mahesh Nagar who is the authorised representative of Sky Light Hospitality. Vadra and his mother Maureen are directors in the firm. The ED probe found that Kumar was used as a conduit by Nagar, brother of Congress MLA Lalit Nagar, who knew the “fraudulent nature of 69.55 hectares Sky Light Hospitality Pvt Ltd purchased for Rs 72 lakh and later sold to Allegeney Finlease Pvt Ltd for Rs 5.15 crore”. According to the ED investigation, Allegeney Finlease was “not involved in any real business activity and its shareholders were found to be dummy/non-existent”. The financial trail of Allegeny showed it had received funds from a leading steel and power firm which it used to purchase the Bikaner land from Sky Light Hospitality. Sources said the agency had questioned all the front entities involved in the Bikaner land scam and Vadra’s questioning was important to establish the actual beneficiary of the deal and take the case for prosecution.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: After crawling up for six months, the price of subsidised cooking gas refill dropped by Rs 6.52 per cylinder and non-subsidised cylinders by Rs 133 each as a reduction in the fuel’s base price pared the applicable tax. A 14.2-kg subsidised LPG cylinder will cost Rs 500.90 in Delhi from Friday against Rs 507.42. The reduction will vary in other states according to the prevalent tax rate. A non-subsidised domestic LPG cylinder will now cost Rs 809.50 in Delhi. Upfront cash payment by the consumer for purchase of domestic LPG refill will reduce by Rs 133 cylinder, i.e. from Rs 942.50 per cylinder to Rs 809.50 cylinder in December in Delhi market, IOC said. Subsidised cooking gas consumers will now get Rs 308.60 per cylinder subsidy for December in their bank accounts, down from Rs 433.66 in November. This is the first reduction in six months, during which the price of subsidised cylinder had cumulatively risen by Rs 14.13 per cylinder due to incremental increase in tax as a result of rising base price. According to the country’s largest fuel retailer IndianOil, the fall reflects fall in international rates and strengthening of the rupee. The prices have been rising marginally for the last six months because GST on LPG has to be calculated at the fuel’s market rate. While the government subsidises part of the price, tax has to be paid at the market rates and is passed on to consumers. Similarly, a fall in market price or non-subsidised LPG price also brings down the tax incidence and results in a reduction in consumer price.',\n",

UP Police has set up two stalls in Lucknow Mahotsav which are drawing crowds and are getting admired. Among the scores of 17th and 18th century arms displayed at the stall, the unusually long barrel Kentucky rifle has become a big attraction. Policemen briefing curious visitors said that at least two people were needed to fire the rifle. The Kentucky rifle was designed in Pennsylvania in early 1700s and produced by German gunsmiths who had immigrated to southern Pennsylvania, hence also known as Pennsylvanian rifle.  “ Humari police ne doosron ke kandhe pe rakh kar chalane wali bandook abhi bhi sambhal kar rakh rakhi hai,” said one visitor tongue in cheek. “ My father clicked my photo with this long rifle. I will post it on social media,” said Farhan, a student of class IX. Among other arms on display, very light pistol used during World War I, muzzle-loading long barrel rifles, 303 calibre rifle no.1 mark 3rd, 7.62mm BA rifle and .303 GF rifle, all used by United Province Police during British era are drew curious onlookers. Old photos at the stall with one of ‘Sultana Daku’ standing with policemen after being awarded death sentence also drew attention. In another photograph, Jawaharlal Nehru is seen inaugurating the police flag on November 23, 1952 at police lines in Lucknow. A rare photograph of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998 is also on display.

       " 'PANAJI: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar has called a meeting of the BJP’s legislature wing on Saturday to discuss the political situation in the state and prepare for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The BJP has 14 seats in the 40-member Goa legislative assembly. A senior BJP functionary told TOI that the meeting is also likely to be attended by government officials. The senior leader said that it has been a while since Parrikar called a meeting of the legislature wing of the party. Previously, the chief minister used to meet the wing every Friday to solve MLAs’ pending issues. Senior party sources told TOI that Parrikar would meet MLAs for half an hour and would ask them to prepare for the Lok Sabha election, so that the BJP wins both seats. Political analysts say that there is growing resentment along the mining belt as the government has not been able to emerge with a solution on the mining issue. Thus, if Parrikar doesn’t have a solution to the problem, the BJP would be compelled to concentrate on non-mining belt constituencies. There is also resentment within the party itself, as the administration has come to a standstill. A senior party functionary said that Parrikar may direct officials at the meeting to clear long-pending development works. Sources in the know said that MLAs are likely to raise the issue of government jobs. When Parrikar last met members of his cabinet, a minister raised the issue, and Parrikar later instructed that the jobs be released. Then, the state government issued an office memorandum (OM) to start recruitment to over 1,200 posts, all of which have been cleared by the high-level empowered committee (HLEC). The state government, before the last assembly election, had banned direct recruitment to avoid resentment among voters. Despite this being undone via the OM, one MLA said that even now, nothing has moved on the recruitment front.',\n",
       " \"PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has reserved its judgment on a petition filed by Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), the BJP's alliance partner in the government seeking to restrain former Congress MLAs Dayanand Sopte and Subhash Shirodkar from contesting the byelections.  The petitioner’s counsel S N Joshi stressed that resignations tendered by Mandrem MLA Sopte and Shiroda MLA Shirodkar were not in accordance with the format laid down under the rules of procedure and conduct of business. To this, the court said “who are we to object” and asked the petitioner to go before an appropriate authority. Joshi said, “They faxed their resignations” and added that the fax were received by speaker Pramod Sawant from Delhi. The petitioner’s counsel also produced before court the faxed resignations. As the resignations were not in accordance with the format laid down, Joshi said the speaker ought to have initiated some inquiry. The “great haste” displayed on the part of the speaker in accepting resignations, said Joshi, shows something was organised. Joshi said the resignations by the two former MLAs defeated the purpose of the anti-defection law. The law was brought after it came to the fore that there were about 2,000 defections spread over two-three years at a particular period. After hearing the counsel, the division bench of the court, R M Borde and Prithviraj Chavan, asked whether the petitioner expected “if the legislators should have gone before the electorate, taken their consent and then resigned.” The court said that if the petitioner’s submission on anti-defection law is accepted, it would also mean imposing restriction on resignation of legislators. Earlier, Justice R M Borde, in response to an additional affidavit filed by the petitioner, said “It leads to nowhere, we are back to square one.” MGP, in its petition said, that material on record is not sufficient enough to show that the resignation of Sopte and Shirodkar was voluntary or genuine. The petitioner alleged that on having joined the BJP, the former MLAs have been rewarded with chairmanship of two different corporations, EDC and GTDC.\",\n",
       " 'VIJAYAWADA/DELHI: The power struggle between Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu and the Centre further escalated with CBI on Friday accusing the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of surreptitiously using information that the central agency had provided to arrest a central government employee. ACB caught Mukku Kali Ramaneswar, superintendent of the Central Tax & Central Excise, while he was accepting a bribe of Rs 30,000 at his office in Machilipatnam. CBI released an official statement alleging that its Visakhapatnam office had first received a written complaint from K Lokesh Babu of Machilipatnam on November 28. Babu alleged that Ramaneswar was demanding a bribe for not raising objections in CGST returns filed by his firm. “CBI regrets such non-cooperation by the state home department in this matter,” the central agency said in the statement. “This will only make the fight against corruption more difficult for the anti-corruption agencies and the mutual trust between the agencies will be vitiated. Corruption can be eradicated only through mutual cooperation and trust.” CBI’s Visakhapatnam SP had written a ‘top secret’ letter to Andhra Pradesh principal secretary (home) on November 28, requesting the state government to issue specific consent for its officers to lay a trap on basis of the complaint. “It was also requested to keep the information strictly confidential and not to share the information with any other party,” the statement said. CBI had also made calls to the principal secretary and sent a request to the chief secretary. “However, the AP government did not issue the specific consent as requested by CBI. Instead, the details were shared by the home department with state ACB and state ACB laid a trap on 30-11-2018 in the evening against the above central government public servant by using the contents of the above request letter,” the statement added. “Further, state ACB also issued a press release as if the complainant has directly approached them.” R P Thakur, ACB DG, said earlier there was a gentleman’s agreement with CBI that ACB would stick to state government employees while CBI pursued central government employees. “Now, with the CBI role in the state being curtailed, ACB has taken this as a first case,” Thakur told TOI. Soon after Ramaneswar took money at 5.20 pm, sleuths barged into the office and recovered the tainted amount. He tested positive in phenolphthalein test. ACB sources said they would register a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act against Ramaneswar. They would also intimate the CGST department head about the arrest of the gazetted officer and recommend departmental action against the accused.',\n",

Acting on the grievances of local residents and local MLA Francisco Silveira, Sardesai said that he would issue a show cause notice to the project proponent and would take a decision on the matter in another 8-10 days. “The point is this, Pilar is a heritage monument and there should have been a buffer,” Sardesai said. “This buffer has not been kept and instead the builder has built the project rampantly.” Though the TCP minister refrained from taking a decision, he said that prima facie, certain rules appear to be flouted. He ordered the TCP department officials to scrutinize the plans and to identify if any violations had been committed. “We will go completely into the process to see if the hill cutting permission has been adhered to and if there is the slightest fault, this project is going to be stopped. We will check contours and everything. They have permission, but the permissions may have been obtained fraudulently,” Sardesai said. Locals and priests from the Pilar monastery have objected to the residential project. The issue was brought up in the last session of the state legislative assembly and Sardesai had given an assurance that he would look into the project. Silveira has demanded that the technical clearance given by the TCP department to the project should be revoked. “It is a sensitive area and it is close to the religious site. They have taken an approval to construct a mega project with 350 flats. This will create a disturbance and future law and order problems,” Silveira said, adding that water scarcity was also a problem for the local residents. “There was clear collusion between the builder and the powers that be in the department,” he said.',\n",

Pointing an accusing finger at the state forest department for letting TDB commit violations, the report said that Sabarimala pilgrimage topped the list of 18 major threats identified by the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) in the tiger conservation plan (TCP). The performance audit in the CAG report on economic sector for the year ended March 31, 2017, said SMP was to be implemented jointly by TDB, TCP and PTR and that solid waste management, water supply, sanitation at Pamba and Sannidhanam were TDB’s responsibility. As per the scrutiny, TDB ‘failed to set up composting facility at Pamba in line with the solid waste management guidelines of SMP, against which the department did not take any action’. “There are two sewage treatment plants (STP) at Sabarimala, one at Pamba and the other at Sannidhanam. A drainage facility to convey waste water of the hotels to Pamba STP was not provided, while the sewage pipes from the buildings near Kumbalam thodu to the STP at Sannidhanam were left unconnected. So overflowing waste water got mixed with Kumbalam thodu, which in turn reached and polluted the Pamba frequented by wild animals,” the report said.

The decision was taken at a Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) council meeting held on Friday, CCP commissioner Ajit Roy said. Roy also said that repeat offenders will be charged a penalty amount of Rs 10,000 to ensure that a strong deterrent prevented the rampant use of plastic carry bags, which are then carelessly discarded and most often end up clogging the city’s drains. “Our ban on plastic carry bags is in force and today, the corporation has taken a decision on the quantum of fine to be levied if a violator is identified,” Roy said. “They have decided that for a first-time violator, the fine amount will be Rs 5,000 and for the second offence the fine amount will be Rs 10,000. This will be effective immediately.” In a council meeting held a couple of months earlier, the corporation had decided not to permit the use or sale of plastic carry bags within CCP’s jurisdiction. A council resolution taken to that effect was sent to the department of municipal administration for notification. “In the meantime, since October 2, we have tried to ensure that this ban is implemented properly and the inspectors are doing their job. Residents and citizens are complying with the order,” Roy said. He clarified that the ban and the fine was applicable to vendors selling plastic bags. Some council members also suggested that fine of a lesser quantum should be imposed on citizens found using plastic carry bags. “Only those bags which are certified as safe will be considered free of plastic,” Roy said. At the meeting, the council also resolved to extend the contract for 287 daily wage workers for a further period of six months. The meeting witnessed a heated discussion over the appointment of a new animal rescue agency and an agency to maintain the municipal gardens and traffic islands.

About 52 backward castes among Muslims are given reservation (under OBC category) at present,” he said. Some castes among Muslims that have reservation are Muslim Bhand, Momin, Ansari, Fakir, Fakir Bandarwala and Panfarosh.

However, those living on the south and southwest margins of the city can expect an early end to their connectivity woes, going by progress of the work. While Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) has officially not revealed the status of work completed on various stretches under Phase II, data sourced by TOI shows two sections — Mysuru Road station to Kengeri and Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura Township — are 81% complete.  However, work on other stretches still appears to be at a crawl: Byappanahalli to Whitefield (39%), Nagasandra to Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (21%), RV Road to Bommasandra (20%) and Gottigere to Diary Circle (7%). Work is to start on sections like Diary Circle-Nagawara, Nagawara to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and Silk Board to KR Puram. While BMRCL had earlier set 2020 as the deadline for the 72-km project, it recently extended it to 2023. But going by its earlier track record, it won’t be a surprise if the deadline is extended till 2025. BMRCL had also set a 2020 deadline for completion of extension of three lines: Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura township, Mysuru Road to Kengeri and Nagasandra to Bangalore International Exhibition Centre. Nagasandra to Bangalore International Exhibition Centre is unlikely to meet the deadline. Byappanahalli to Whitefield and RV Road to Bommasandra lines are expected to be ready by 2021. Both these lines are crucial, particularly for techies in Whitefield and Electronics City. However, the former, which is an extension line, is likely to be operational first. BMRCL has fixed 2023 as the deadline for Gottigere to Diary Circle, Diary Circle to Nagawara, Nagawara to KIA and Silk Board to KR Puram routes. BMRCL has again floated tenders for the Dairy Circle-Nagawara line after the lowest bid received in the previous tender was Rs 8,553 crore compared to its estimate of Rs 5,047 crore. The tender is expected to be finalized in two months. Tenders are yet to be floated for the Nagawara-KIA line, cash-strapped Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) has emerged as the lowest bidder for the KR Puram-Silk Board corridor, in all three packages. However, BMRCL is yet to take a decision. Line to airport hits block While the second KIA terminal is expected to be completed by 2021, Namma Metro’s airport connectivity plan has hit a roadblock. Passenger growth at the airport is expected to touch 70 million by 2029 from the present 27 million. But the government is yet to decide on BMRCL’s proposal to change the earlier alignment via RK Hegde Nagar and Jakkur since it passes through a high-pressure petroleum line. BMRCL is now planning to build the airport line via Hebbal and extend the airport Metro line from KR Puram instead of Nagawara. It also has to mobilise funds after the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) rejected the proposal to raise Rs 1,000 crore through user development fee from airport passengers.',\n",

       " 'Amritsar: The Pakistan government may have announced to give visa-free access to devotees to walk through the proposed Kartarpur Corridor to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, but questioned are being being raised on what process will India adopt. Neither of the two countries are likely to allow anyone to cross the border without proper identification and vetting, say security experts. Sources told TOI on Friday that while it was too early to say anything in absence of requisite guidelines from the Union government, India was likely to maintain proper record of the devotees and their criminal past, if any, and may also have some mechanism of police vetting before allowing anyone to go for visa-free pilgrimage to Pakistan through the corridor. At present, both India and Pakistan have an arrangement of issuing special permits to the truck drivers crossing the international border for trade activities at Integrated Check Posts (ICP). “They also travel without visa but they do have special permit issued for a specific duration and carry their identification cards, which are issued after police vetting,” said sources. The Pakistani drivers too arrive in India on special permit and unload their goods at a designated place. They are not allowed to leave ICP and are required to return to their home country by 12am. Sources said that Pakistan might have announced a visa-free travel to Kartarpur Sahib but it would also maintain proper record of devotees for security reasons. “There is a mechanism of giving access to a person to travel to other country without visa but there are mandatory guidelines and a set mechanism. For travelling through Kartarpur Corridor, things are being worked out, suggestions are being taken from all stakeholders,” said government sources. “The possibility is that there will be a single entry permit system by which a person will travel to Pakistan through the corridor and will have access to a limited place, which could be the Gurdwara complex, and return in a time bound manner,” sources in a government security agency said. Devotees wouldn’t be allowed to move out of a particular complex or the fenced area.',\n",

They want the municipal council to get rid of the monkeys in their area to sway their votes. The ward has approximately 3,500 votes. Rajinder Kumar, a government employee and a resident of Bharat Colony, said that an army of 300 monkeys have taken siege of the colony lanes and rooftops, making it impossible for the residents to negotiate their way into the colony. “When children come home after school, there is a risk of being bitten by monkeys,” he said. Rajiv Kadiyan, another resident, who runs a school, said that an army of monkeys appeared all of a sudden, three months ago. “We have registered complaints at the municipal corporation over the phone and on WhatsApp but failed to elicit positive response from the authorities,” he said. Krishan Dhull, a government servant, said that since the monkey menace is a collective problem, they decided to put this as their demand to mayoral candidates. According to Dhull, monkey bites have become commonplace in their locality. Advocate Veena Malik, who is canvassing for CPM candidate Jagmati Sangwan told TOI that they were taken aback by the demand of the residents. “Voters usually ask us for better roads, electricity or drinking water.

       " 'Chandigarh: Apprehending disruption of public life on account of a protest called by a teachers’ body in Patiala on Sunday, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday made it clear that such demonstration would be permitted only at a designated place identified by the district administration. Police in Patiala have also been directed to ensure that people coming to the agitation do not carry weapons, including firearms, knives, lathis and others. The organizers have also been directed to give an undertaking to the administration that they would ensure a peaceful protest at the designated venue only. Police and the state government have been directed to ensure that a video of the entire protest is shot. The court has also directed the police to keep a strict vigil and regulate traffic on all entry points of Patiala. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Krishna Murari and Justice Arun Palli passed these orders while taking cognizance of a petition filed by a high court lawyer. “Needless to say that as citizens of this country, the respondents’ associations and their members have a right to protest for consideration of their lawful demands, but the right is of a ‘peaceful’ agitation/demonstration. In the name of agitation, those agitating cannot be permitted to take law into their hands and disrupt the life of general public by resorting to blocking roads, causing damage to the public property,” observed the bench. The matter reached before the bench in the wake of a public interest litigation filed by Mohit Kapoor, a local lawyer expressing apprehension over disruption of life on account of the protest on Sunday. The petitioner had sought directions to protect life, liberty and property of public at large, especially citizens of Patiala and to direct the state government to ensure that no untoward incident takes place resulting into loss of life, limb or property of the public. Many teachers in Punjab who have been working under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rastriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan (RMSA), have made a call for the protest demanding regularisation of jobs at their current salary and not on probation.',\n",

       " 'Bathinda: The opening of Kartarpur Sahib corridor has rekindled hopes of the opening of Hussainiwala-Ganda Singh Wala border route for trade and transit, just like the Attari-Wagah border post. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s promise to open more shrines in the neighbouring country, like Sharda Peeth in Kashmir, to devotees in India has added to the optimism. Demand for reopening the Hussainiwala border route for trade with Pakistan, which was active till the 1971 war between India and Pakistan, has been made for long. Hussaniwala is located situated just near the Radcliff line in Ferozepur district. It is here that the half-burnt bodies of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were cremated on the banks of Satluj river on March 23, 1931, after they were executed at Central Jail, Lahore. The area across the Satluj is topographically close to Pakistan. Retired bureaucrat Kulbir Singh Sidhu, who has served as deputy commissioner and divisional commissioner of Ferozepur, said Hussainiwala was an important route for trade and transit in Punjab, and should be opened with “mutual understanding”. “It is also an emotional chord between people on both sides of the border, especially for those residing nearby,” he said. Historian Rakesh Kumar said the Hussainiwala-Ganda Singh Wala border had “immense social and economic value”. “People in Indian and Pakistan will welcome efforts to open it,” he said. Punjab Cotton Factories and Ginners Association former president Bhagwan Bansal said the opening of the Hussainiwala trade route would be of “immense benefit” to both countries. “Hussainiwala is part of Malwa region, which is also cotton belt. Cotton, yarn and basmati rice could be exported through the Hussainiwala border,” he said. All India Combine Manufacturers Association general secretary Amar Singh said combines could be exported to Pakistan through Hussainiwala, and those would help Pakistan farmers save money. Before he unfurled the national flag in Ferozepur on Independence Day last year, Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had stressed on the need to reopen the border route. At the time, he had said that a strong case should be made for reopening the Hussainiwala border for trade between India and Pakistan, as was the case before the 1971 war. Before this, former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had echoed similar sentiments in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to Hussainiwala on March 23, 2015, to pay tributes to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev.',\n",
       " 'Manali: With weak western disturbances failing to bring snowfall and rain, dry cold has gripped entire Himachal Pradesh. Contrary to the earlier assumptions following rampant monsoon that Himachal may see aggressive winter season with repeated spells of heavy snowfall, there are no signs of snowy clouds. The western disturbances originating from Mediterranean sea, which bring snow and rain to northern India in winter months, are weak so far. The state is mostly witnessing sunny days and starry nights. Yet, the many places in state are reeling under subzero temperature. According to a private weather channel, there is no confirmation of good snowfall in mid-hills of Himachal, including Shimla, in December. Shimla meteorological centre has predicted dry weather for next seven days. At minus 3.2 degrees Celsius, Keylong is again the coldest place in Himachal. Temperature at higher places is low also and water sources have turned into solid ice. Manali resident Sumant Kumar said, “Nearly no snowfall in last winter season had badly affected tourism, fruit production and crops in Himachal. We don’t want those conditions again. This year we are in desperate need of heavy snowfall. We had witnessed light snowfall earlier this month which indicated good winter season ahead. However, now the weather is indicating something quite different. We still hope for good snowfall as we have full winter season ahead.” Both day and night temperatures of state capital Shimla too have dipped in recent days. On Friday, minimum and maximum temperatures of Shimla were recorded at 6.6 and 17.9 degrees C respectively. In Manali, people spend days basking in sun. The day temperature here is below 15 degrees C and night temperature is close to freezing point. Residents woke up to a thin layer of frost on Friday. Despite absence of rain and snowfall, residents have two reasons not to worry – cold, availability of snow on hills and enough moisture in soil. According to local meteorological centre, the maximum and minimum temperature in Himachal are normal for this time of the season. “The temperature is very much less than that of last year in the end of November. This will help in conversion of rain into snowfall. The soil has enough moisture. This is good for fruit plants and other crops,” an apple grower Rajesh Negi said. Tourists are getting to see snow at Gulaba and nearby areas. The snow will last for many weeks due to low temperature. So, dry weather conditions are not worrying tourism entrepreneurs so far.',\n",

The court has directed Kolianwali to surrender before the state vigilance bureau within a week. Kolianwali has been evading arrest for nearly five months. In July, a Mohali district court had dismissed his bail application. Later, the Punjab and Haryana high court too had rejected his plea. The Punjab vigilance bureau filed a caveat in the Supreme Court on November 27, after it got to know that Kolianwali had moved an anticipatory bail application. The Akali leader belongs to Kolianwali village in Lambi assembly segment, which is represented by Badal in the state assembly. He is accused of amassing illegal wealth through corrupt means during the previous SAD-BJP government in the state. He was also the sarpanch of Kolianwali village, member of Punjab Subordinate Services Selection Board (PSSSB) and chairman of Punjab Agro Industries Corporation during the Badal government’s rule from 2007 to 2017.

He said he had held a meeting with secretary Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) Tariq Wazir in presence of PSGPC president Tara Singh and former president Bishan Singh on Thursday to discuss at length about the celebrations of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, other Sikh issues including Nanakshahi Calendar and visit to Sikh historical shrines in Pakistan. He said ahead of the birth anniversary, a series of religious functions would be held at Nankana Sahb for three months and SGPC would make arrangements of sending Sikh religious preachers and hymn singers. On the lines of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) that has offered to construct 100-room sarai at Kartarpur Sahib, Longowal said that SGPC had also offered PSGPC and Pakistan government to make relevant arrangement for the devotees and the celebration functions. Expressing serious concern over land sharks that has encroached upon gurdwara properties in Lahore, he said he had visited gurdwara of Bhai Mani Singh Shaheed and Bhai Taru Singh situated in a congested street of Lahore but was disappointed to see that not only the shrine was in a state of utter neglect but it had also been encroached upon. “I am leading a delegation of SGPC to Pakistan again on January 13, then we will discuss issues of these gurdwaras with the Pakistan government,” he said.',\n",
       " 'CHANDIGARH: The Kartarpur Sahib corridor has brought the rather nondescript town of Dera Baba Nanak into the limelight and to check haphazard growth in the area, the state government has decided to set up the ‘Dera Baba Nanak Development Authority’. What’s more, the state will soon begin acquiring land and it has been decided to prepare a master plan of the area for futuristic development.  Punjab minister for housing and urban development Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa told TOI, “From being the last stop ahead of the international border, the historic town of Dera Baba Nanak will now be turned into the first Indian town on this side. It will witness development deserving of the point from where the 5.4-kilometer corridor will lead to Pakistan. All sorts of facilities that are required for tourists and pilgrims will be provided. Since chief minister Amarinder Singh has already given a go ahead, the development authority would be constituted in the next few weeks.” “Land will be acquired on the basis of the master plan and the facilities planned there in by the town and country planning department,” he added. Sources said since lakhs of people are likely to converge on Dera Baba Nanak, the town planning department has been asked to explore the possibility of setting up hotels, affordable housing and even malls to develop the right ecosystem. This comes amid reports that investors have already started showing interest in the area, realising its potential once the corridor comes up. Prices of commercial land have already shot up in Dera Baba Nanak and its adjoining places. Meanwhile, sources added that the orders for the development authority and master plan were issued on Wednesday. It reads, “It has been felt that for preparation of the master plan for Dera Baba Nanak and carry out developmental works effectively, there is need for setting up a development authority.” The department of rural development and panchayats, which is also with Bajwa, has been entrusted with the task of ensuring development in three villages — Chahal Kalan, Pakhoke Dera Baba Nanak and Vadala Granthian, which associated with the life of Sri Guru Nanak Dev, at a cost of Rs 3 crore each. An official pointed out that even before the Kartarpur issue came up, the state government had embarked upon a plan to carry out developmental works in Dera Baba Nanak for the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev. “But now, the area could well turn into a tourist hub in the coming days if the corridor becomes a reality,” he added. As part of the year-long celebrations, the state government has already announced infrastructural works worth Rs 965 crore to ensure holistic development of the historic town of Dera Baba Nanak and adjoining areas of Gurdaspur. Property dealers in the area are already elated at the prospects of the area turning into a major tourist place. “We have been getting queries from hoteliers and other investors in Delhi and other far off places who are keen to come up with facilities in Dera Baba Nanak. Land prices have already gone up and owners are expecting further appreciation. Locals see bright prospects in a scenario of slump in the reality sector,” said Kamal Dhiman, a property consultant from the area. Facelift for Dera Baba Nanak — A separate development authority — Master plan for the area — Land acquisition by state — Facilities like hotels, parking lots and malls — Strengthening of infrastructure No suspension of land transfer Cabinet minister Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa clarified that contrary to certain reports, transfer of land had not been suspended in the area where the proposed Kartarpur Sahib corridor is planned to be built.',\n",
       " \"CHANDIGARH: CBI’s special crime branch at Chandigarh has registered a case in a custodial death of an under trial in Amritsar central jail way back in November 2013. The central agency is going to probe the role of as many as 32 Punjab government officials in the case. As many as 22 injuries were found on deceased Raju’s body during the postmortem. The medical authorities had attributed the cause of death to failure of the function of brain as a result of injuries. It was on September 18 this year that the Punjab and Haryana high court had transferred the case to the CBI. The high court, after going through the affidavit filed by Punjab's bureau of investigation director Prabodh Kumar had noted that the state police SIT “is trying to illegitimately come to the aid of the police officials who were found to be prima facie responsible for this custodial death.” The case was transferred to the CBI by the high court on plea deceased Raju’s widowed mother, Manjit Kaur, a resident of Amritsar. The high court had further noted, “Since a number of police officials of various ranks including senior functionaries as well as doctors and the jail staff appear to be prima faice involved/responsible for this death and such a machination apparently is aimed to nullifying the effects and thus, giving undue benefit to the persons who are accused of commission of such a heinous offence.” Amritsar district and sessions judge had earlier mentioned in his inquiry report submitted to the high court that though deceased Raju was in Amritsar jail, but none had come forward to tell as to who had caused injuries to him. Raju was taken for treatment by the jail authorities to OPD in Amritsar hospital instead of the emergency ward and the medical officer did not properly conduct his medical examination. Even the case history was not written on the admission record. It had also come to fore that deceased Raju’s relatives were not informed by the Amritsar jail authorities on November 2, 2013, when he fell ill and also on November 4, 2013, when he was serious and referred to Guru Nanak Dev Hospital. It was also found that the request to conduct the inquest proceedings was not made to the jail judicial magistrate, rather inquest proceedings were got conducted from executive magistrate. Also, viscera were kept by head constable Madan Mohan and he did not deposit it to the chemical examiner at Kharar. Manjit Kaur had initially approached the high court in 2013, seeking investigation of the case through an independent agency. Amritsar district and sessions judge had in 2015, submitted his inquiry report to the high court and had held the 32 jail officials responsible for the death. Thereafter in December 2015, the high court directed the Amritsar police to register an FIR for murder against the 32 officials and had constituted a special investigation team to probe the case.\",\n",
       " 'CHANDIGARH: Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s statement that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is his captain, not chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, has left some leaders in the party’s state unit, especially those loyal to the CM, dumbstruck, while others say they want to “wait and watch” on how the situation unfolds. When contacted, Amritsar West MLA Rajkumar Verka, also a Congress spokesperson, said the party’s “viewpoint” was that Rahul had made Amarinder the “captain of Punjab”. “He is head of the state and Sidhu is a member of his team. So, Amarinder is Sidhu’s captain as well. We have seen his statement on channels only and no one has spoken to him. The party would want to know (what he meant). The party considers Amarinder as the captain and doesn’t agree with Sidhu’s statement,” he said. “We will examine Sidhu’s statement before reaching a decision.” A Congress MLA, who did not wish to be named, said it was “ironic” that while Congress ran a poll campaign in which it showed Amarinder as its ‘Punjab Da Kaptan’, Sidhu said he was only a captain of the Army. “The statement is not in good taste. No doubt, Rahulji is our overall leader, but you cannot make light of your chief minister in this way,” he said. Congress leaders said though Sidhu’s wife, former MLA Navjot Kaur, had openly criticized the state government on some occasions recently, this was the first time that Sidhu spoke out of turn. “It comes close on the heels of Amarinder snubbing Sidhu with a statement that he had asked him to reconsider his decision to go to Pakistan for the ground-breaking ceremony of Kartarpur Sahib corridor. Sidhu is on a high after the project was given a go-ahead. He has also been picked by the party’s central leadership to campaign in three poll-bound states. The statement may also be seen in that context,” said a leader. Meanwhile, there are Congress leaders who said the statement was being blown out of proportion. “He only tried to avoid answering a question and the entire thing is being shown out of context. He has already clarified that he has utmost regard for the chief minister and insisted on going to Pakistan because he already made a commitment,” said a Congress leader. In the past, Sidhu and Amarinder have not been on the same page on certain issues, including action against the family of former CM Parkash Singh Badal, for their stake in the cable business. Sidhu is known to have put his foot down on several issues in meetings of council of ministers.',\n",

       " 'Jalandhar: As the work on Kartarpur corridor has started, common refrain in the industry in Punjab is that trade between two Punjabs on either side of Radcliffe Line should also be encouraged as it holds immense potential. “The Kartarpur Corridor is a very good step and has created a lot of goodwill among people. Let Karam (trade) follow Dharam (religion). Our only wish is that Wagah is opened for trade. It holds immense potential for Punjab and for other neighbouring states as well as for Pakistani Punjab,” said Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, chairman of Punjab chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce. Industry sources said that due to restrictions only a few items can be sent through land route. Importers and exporters on both sides have to send or receive items through sea route. “First industrialists from Punjab send products through Kandla (Gujarat) or Nhava Sheva (Maharashtra) ports to Dubai from where these are sent to Karachi port and then to Punjab in Pakistan. What can reach there just by covering 40-50 km covers thousands of kilometres. It would not only help the business thrive but the environmental impact would also be good with things reaching there through very short route,” he added. An exhibition and trade fair is being organized by the chamber from December 6 to 10 at Amritsar. “It was started in 2005, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the chief minister. This is the 13th edition of the fair,”Sachdeva said. “However, earlier exchange of business delegations was better. For the last three years, both the countries are not giving visas easily. This time also we are getting only 4-5 exhibitors directly who have SAARC visas and others would be holding their stalls through their local contacts or dealers. The businessmen from there now have stopped applying for visas as the wait for visa was being made torturous,” Sachdeva revealed. Echoing similar sentiments Chamber of Industry and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja, whose unit at Ludhiana manufactures auto components, farm machinery and bicycle components, said that there was immense potential of trade with Pakistan. “We have been demanding for the last 20 years that trade with Pakistan should be opened,” he said. “Trade with Pakistan holds key to huge markets further and Punjab cen benefit from it immensely,” said Hand Tools Manufacturing Association secretary Ashwani Vitcor. Farmers also raise voice If export of potatoes is allowed to Pakistan then all the growers can be saved, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha. “Here we are going in losses for third consecutive year while prices of potato are very good in Pakistan. We are not getting orders from Indian market and opening Pakistan can save the situation,” he added.',\n",

The government had asked 8,886 teachers working under Sarv Sikhya Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and other societies to submit their choice by midnight of November 30. Till 7pm, 4,586 had opted for regularisation of service, while around 3,900 had not made any choice. Only eight teachers have opted to stay back in the societies. Of total 8,886, the department had regularised around 400 teachers in month of July. Punjab Teacher and Education Welfare Association stated that a large number of teachers could not make a choice as they were confused and requested the government to give them another chance for making a choice. President of the association Sanjay Kumar said that they had submitted a memorandum to the education secretary with request to extend the deadline. “A lot of teachers failed to make a choice due to false propaganda regarding terms and condition of regularisation,” said the teacher, who has also opted for regularisation. The state government on October 9, issued a notification in compliance with the decision taken by the cabinet on October 3, that the teachers working in Centre-sponsored schemes SSA, RMSA will be regularised in the department. The teachers will be paid monthly salary of Rs 15,300 during the probation period of three years, starting from April 1, 2018. At present, the contractual teachers are being paid Rs 42,800 per month. Punjab education minister O P Soni said another chance would be given to teachers who failed to make any choice. “For benefit of contractual teachers, who could not make any choice for any reasons, will be given more time,” said Soni. The government had first set October 23 as the deadline, but later extended the last date till November 30 after lukewarm response. Teacher unions under the Sanjha Morcha are up in arms against the government for terms and conditions framed for regularisation. Convenor of the morcha Sukhwinder Chahal accused the government of using pressure tactics for making the teachers opt for regularisation. “They used every trick in the book to force teachers,” alleged Chahal. He said that they would stage a massive protest in Patiala on December 2.

Mukesh has approached the Punjab and Haryana high court challenging his suspension orders. In his petition, the state civil service officer alleged that action against him has been taken so that the additional demand of around Rs 8 crore, which was being raised by him from Ashkit Properties Ltd in lieu of some commercial property as per the instructions of the government, would not be raised and the matter would be brushed aside under the carpet. He has also claimed that the fact that another HCS officer, Bharat Bhushan Gogia, has been given the charge after his suspension, shows that the efforts were being made by the persons involved in the matter to brush aside the misappropriation of amount of around Rs 8 crore in collusion with the firm. “That petitioner had contemplated to take action against the erring official who had acted in contravention of the state government instructions issued on April 13, 2018, and had caused a huge loss of Rs 8,11,14,000 to the state exchequer.

Just a week after the area was cleared, both irregular parking of private and public transport vehicles and encroachment by vendors are back in the area, giving commuters a tough time. On November 22, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma and SSP Kalanidhi Naithani had supervised an anti-encroachment drive in Gole Market and removed a large number of squatters. Since the traffic coming down the Nishatganj flyover faced bottlenecks on the roundabout, SSP had directed traffic cops to stop irregular parking outside shops.  However, when TOI visited the area on Friday evening, a week after the action by DM and SSP, irregular parking and encroachments were back, and so were traffic snarls. Since Gole Market is a common transit point for people going towards Indiranagar, Nishatganj, Aliganj and Gomtinagar, the area witnesses traffic congestion in peak hours on a daily basis due to irregular parking and encroachment. Vehicles were parked haphazardly on the road, posing inconvenience to commuters. Commuters said that street parking was the major reason for traffic snarls. “The auto-rickshaws and tempos also cause massive traffic congestion during peak hours. In order to get more passengers, the drivers block road and stop vehicle anywhere to pick up passengers, posing threat to commuters,” said Mamta Raizada, a shopper. Aditya Tiwari, a shopkeeper, said, “Police came a few days ago and removed encroachments and irregular parked vehicles. Unke jate hi phir sab pehle jaisa ho gaya. Encroachment to phir bhi tora kam hua hai lekin parking abhi bhi vaise hi hai,” he added. In the absence of any checks, shopkeepers have also extended their shops, leaving no space for pedestrians. Locals and commuters, however, pinned the blame for the mess on police and local administration, accusing them of not taking stern action against violators and not following up. “Traffic police have failed to take any initiative for curbing traffic congestion,” said Shobhit Saxena, a commuter. When TOI asked SSP Kalanidhi Naithani about irregular parking and encroachment in Gole market troubling commuters again, he said that police is soon starting a drive to put check on irregular parking in the city. “I visited Gole Market today also and directed traffic police to remove all irregular parking.

The Handigodu patients’ welfare association has decided to send a representation to this effect to the CM and the commission. A rare joint disorder leading to crippling and permanent disability, ‘Handigodu’ — named after a village near Sagar in Shivamogga — was first noticed in 1974. The cause of the disease has remained unknown to the medical community. Those affected suffer from low immunity, crippling and require physiotherapy. According to the association, there are over 300 ‘Handigodu’ patients in Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru districts and most are from the Chalavadi and Channaiah communities (Scheduled Castes). The patients are immobile due to dwarfism, joint pain and weakness. Many can’t even crawl on their limbs and are dependent on their families. The patients have been demanding a pension of Rs 5,000 per person per month. “There are many children who have kept away from school after they were diagnosed with the disorder. Scientists from Indian Council of Medical Research have also done research on us, but that has not helped improve our condition; we continue to suffer as our health is deteriorating. The government should either provide us medical help and get us physiotherapy or grant us permission to kill ourselves as the disorder has crippled our lives,” said Rajendra Bandagadde, 54, president, Handigodu patients’ welfare association.

For some heavyweights, a loss marks an uncertain future, while for freshers a severe jolt. The most talked about high-profile constituency in the state is Budhni in Sehore district from where three-time chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is seeking a re-election. Pitted against his is former state Congress chief Arun Yadav and son of late Subhash Yadav, a prominent farmer and cooperatives leader from the state. The presence of Yadav, an OBC candidate having a wide acceptability among farmers had spiced up the contest in Budhni. A win for Chouhan and a defeat for the BJP in state will put him in a spot of bother. After representing Lok Sabha for five terms, he was sent to MP as chief minister and he made history by being re-elected thrice. Now, Chouhan will have to find a role for himself in the state or at the Centre in case the party suffers a setback, say political pundits. Likewise, MP Assembly Speaker Sitasharan Sharma is locked in a tough battle against veteran Sartaj Singh, who turned rebel and was fielded by the Congress after BJP refused to give him a ticket from Hoshangabad. In this tussle, Sitasharan finds himself pitted against his own mentor and Guru. Sartaj was the leader who helped BJP win and strengthen its foothold in Hoshangabad Lok Sabha seat. He was dropped from the Shivraj cabinet based on 75+ age criteria along with former chief minister Babulal Gaur and not fielded by the party. Sartaj is so well entrenched in the constituency that he had defeated senior Congress leader late Arjun Singh from Hoshangabad in 1998 Lok Sabha general elections. In Bhojpur, all eyes are on Congress veteran Suresh Pachauri, who had served as minister of state for defence in the Union cabinet during PV Narasimha Rao's government. Pachauri, a Rajya Sabha member for long time, is fighting a decisive battle against BJP minister Surendra Patwa from the industrial hub of Madhya Pradesh. An interesting battle is also in the offing in Waraseoni, where Sanjay Masani, brother-in-law of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has locked horns with the sitting BJP MLA, Yogendra Nirmal. Masani is fighting his first poll against the saffron party, for which he had been working since last 13 years. He also hit limelight by switching over to Congress for this ticket. Both, Congress and BJP are facing a tough challenge from Gaurav Pandit, an independent candidate, who has a big sway among Pawar community members in the region. Another first-timer for electoral battle, tribal leader, Dr Hiralal Alawa, who challenged both Congress and BJP in Dhar and Jhabua district on tribal issues, shocked everyone including his supporters by joining the fray as a Congress candidate from Manawar. Banking upon the tribal support, Alawa is challenging former minister Ranjana Baghel. A few other novices have also been drawn into the poll battle including Akash, son of BJP heavyweight Kailash Vijayavargiya in Indore-3 where he is locked in a keen battle against former Congress MLA, Ashwin Joshi.

       " \"BHOPAL: The assembly elections held on Wednesday will prove to be make-or-break for several prominent politicians, as they await the people's verdict sealed in the EVMs till December 11.  For some heavyweights, a loss marks an uncertain future, while for freshers a severe jolt. The most talked about high-profile constituency in the state is Budhni in Sehore district from where three-time chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is seeking a re-election. Pitted against his is former state Congress chief Arun Yadav and son of late Subhash Yadav, a prominent farmer and cooperatives leader from the state. The presence of Yadav, an OBC candidate having a wide acceptability among farmers had spiced up the contest in Budhni. A win for Chouhan and a defeat for the BJP in state will put him in a spot of bother. After representing Lok Sabha for five terms, he was sent to MP as chief minister and he made history by being re-elected thrice. Now, Chouhan will have to find a role for himself in the state or at the Centre in case the party suffers a setback, say political pundits. Likewise, MP Assembly Speaker Sitasharan Sharma is locked in a tough battle against veteran Sartaj Singh, who turned rebel and was fielded by the Congress after BJP refused to give him a ticket from Hoshangabad. In this tussle, Sitasharan finds himself pitted against his own mentor and Guru. Sartaj was the leader who helped BJP win and strengthen its foothold in Hoshangabad Lok Sabha seat. He was dropped from the Shivraj cabinet based on 75+ age criteria along with former chief minister Babulal Gaur and not fielded by the party. Sartaj is so well entrenched in the constituency that he had defeated senior Congress leader late Arjun Singh from Hoshangabad in 1998 Lok Sabha general elections. In Bhojpur, all eyes are on Congress veteran Suresh Pachauri, who had served as minister of state for defence in the Union cabinet during PV Narasimha Rao's government. Pachauri, a Rajya Sabha member for long time, is fighting a decisive battle against BJP minister Surendra Patwa from the industrial hub of Madhya Pradesh. An interesting battle is also in the offing in Waraseoni, where Sanjay Masani, brother-in-law of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has locked horns with the sitting BJP MLA, Yogendra Nirmal. Masani is fighting his first poll against the saffron party, for which he had been working since last 13 years. He also hit limelight by switching over to Congress for this ticket. Both, Congress and BJP are facing a tough challenge from Gaurav Pandit, an independent candidate, who has a big sway among Pawar community members in the region. Another first-timer for electoral battle, tribal leader, Dr Hiralal Alawa, who challenged both Congress and BJP in Dhar and Jhabua district on tribal issues, shocked everyone including his supporters by joining the fray as a Congress candidate from Manawar. Banking upon the tribal support, Alawa is challenging former minister Ranjana Baghel. A few other novices have also been drawn into the poll battle including Akash, son of BJP heavyweight Kailash Vijayavargiya in Indore-3 where he is locked in a keen battle against former Congress MLA, Ashwin Joshi. BJP has also fielded two young leaders - Fatima Rasool Siddiqui from Bhopal North against Congress heavyweight and five-time winner, Arif Aqueel while, in Sanchi (Raisen) and Mudit, son of cabinet minister Gaurishankar Shejwar, who decided to withdraw from the fray.

       " 'CHANDIGARH: MC commissioner K K Yadav alleged being threatened by BJP councillor Chandrawati Shukla’s husband in the MC house meeting on Friday. The councillor’s husband, Gopal Shukla, who was present in the visitors’ gallery of the MC house denied threatening anyone and said the commissioner’s behaviour during the house meet was dictatorial. The dispute began when councillor Chandrawati Shukla raised the issue of the removal illegal water motor pumps (tullu/pressure pumps) installed by residents in her ward, Sector 52. She accused the MC commissioner of targeting her ward deliberately. During the last MC house meeting, she had thrown dirty water collected from houses in her ward on the floor. The civic body issued a show cause notice to her over this. In response to Shukla’s allegation, the commissioner said MC officials were only doing their duty. The MC had written to the SDM on November 6, asking for police force to conduct the drive, which was held on November 21. MC commissioner K K Yadav said someone used the councillor’s phone and threatened him for 12 minutes. Without naming the councillor’s husband, the commissioner asked in which capacity did the person use the councillor’s phone and threaten him. “I respect you but that person continuously threatened me for 12 minutes. I will not tolerate such behaviour in future,” Yadav told councillor Chandrawati Shukla. On her part, the councillor said her husband spoke to him because she was busy trying to mollify people whose water pumps had been removed by the MC staff. She also denied any threat by her husband.',\n",

A year later, the girls got to meet them in Bengaluru on Friday. Disha KG, 3, from Tamil Nadu, who was suffering from Hurler Syndrome, a lysosomal storage disorder, met her stem cell donor Prakash Kumar from Udupi. Mumbai-based Vanshika, 5, who was cured of thalassemia after a bone-marrow transplant, met her stem cell donor Dr Shruti Kakkar, a haemotologist from Ludhiana. It was an emotional moment as both families had no clue about the angel donors till Friday. “Dr Shruti gave my daughter Vanshika a second innings in life for which we will remain eternally grateful,” said Janvi Rohra. Dr Shruthi, who treats patients with thalassemia, said she was thrilled when she learnt her stem cells were matching with a needy patient. “I encourage everyone to register for stem cell donation, as that would help some matching recipient get back to life. I was on gluten-free diet for two months before the stem cell donation to be able to stay fit,” said Dr Shruti. Vanshika is now all set to go to school. Prakash, a private company employee, was surprised seeing Disha, who got a fresh lease of life from his stem cells. Friday, incidentally, was Prakash’s birthday. The transplants were made possible with the help of Datri, India’s largest stem cell registry. Datri has so far coordinated 470 blood stem cell donations and has over 3.7 lakh persons registered as voluntary donors.',\n",

The instruction followed the inspection of the ongoing Metro work in the riverbed, which was conducted by Mhaisekar and the NGT-constituted expert committee members on Friday. The Metro would run on about 1.4km in the riverbed, starting from Karve Road (near Khandujibaba Chowk) up to Congress Bhavan. “Take all the necessary steps to ensure that there is no obstruction to the flow of river water, no impact on its biodiversity and no pollution,” Mhaisekar told the MahaMetro officials after the inspection. He also told them to put in place all measures to ensure the safety of Metro and its passengers during a flood-like situation. The visit was followed by a meeting held at the divisional commissioner’s office, in which a detailed discussion was held pertaining to the environment protection in the riverbed. “At the meeting, discussions were also held regarding the construction of Metro stations at Sambhaji Park and Deccan Gymkhana, besides the proposals to set up parking bays in the Deccan Gymkhana area and near the Metro stations,” MahaMetro officials said. Mhaisekar told the MahaMetro officials to follow guidelines issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the recommendations of the expert committee. The MahaMetro has initiated civil work for construction of Metro pillars and stations in the riverbed stretch. The work was stopped for a few days during the monsoon due to the water release in the river from Khadakwasla dam. The work has restarted last month. The riverbed stretch is the part of the Metro’s Vanaz to Civil Court line, which will further go up to Ramwadi. The entire corridor is elevated.',\n",

       " \"In the latest episode of Bigg Boss 12, contestants wake up and right at the start of the day, Surbhi begins to provoke Sreesanth by mentioning his slapgate controversy with Bhajji and the phase in which he was banned from playing cricket. She asks him to stop playing the emotional card to win sympathy votes.  Dipika tries to calm down Sreesanth but in vain as Surbhi continues to annoy Sreesanth. In a fit of rage, Sreesanth calls Surbhi 'characterless'. This gives Surbhi another excuse to get back at the former cricketer.   Sreesanth asks Rohit what Surbhi's age is and learns that she is 30. When Surbhi teases him again, Sreesanth asks her not to behave like a 6-year-old. He also calls her mentally unstable. Sreesanth goes to the washroom area and takes off his mic to talk to Dipika. Dipika, Megha and Jasleen ask Sreesanth not to get provoked by Surbhi as this is what she wants. When Sreesanth continues to react, Dipika gives up on him and leaves. Bigg Boss asks contestants to nominate three inmates for 'kaal kothri ki saza'.  This leads to a fight between Dipika and Surbhi. Deepak and Surbhi accuse Dipika of supporting Sreesanth even when he is wrong. Dipika tells them that everyone supports their friends here and so will she. Surbhi calls Dipika boring and the latter tells her she would not stoop to her level to gain attention.  Eventually, Surbhi, Deepak and Sreesanth are sent to the jail by the rest. They settle themselves. Meanwhile, Bigg Boss comes up with another task. He selects three representatives for the contestants in 'kaal kothri'. They have to dig the ice box kept in the garden area and find a key which will help them save whoever they want.  In the task, Megha wins. She is helped by Dipika and they get Sreesanth out of the jail. Surbhi tells Megha she should have taken out a more deserving candidate than Sreesanth. Megha tells the same to Sreesanth but she knows she has done the right thing by releasing him.  Megha Dhade is then called by Bigg Boss for a secret task. She is asked to keep nimbu, mirchi and needles strategically in the house and make the contestants believe next morning there is a 'bura saaya' in the house.   Meanwhile, Rohit tells Romil his game is bad. Rohit also goes and tells Deepak how Rohit had earlier said that he has come this far in the game due to him. Deepak feels offended at this. Later in the kitchen area, Rohit accuses Romil of staring at him.   At night, Megha does what Bigg Boss had asked her to. She comes back to Jasleen's bed instead. And tells her she is feeling scared as she suddenly felt jolted by someone while she was sleeping.   Later, Jasleen wakes up to go the washroom next and spots the 'nimbu mirchi'. She feels scared.\",\n",
